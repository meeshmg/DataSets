A critical part of Flagstaff's climate plan proposed that all new construction get to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 and that the city promote ""aggressive building electrification"" to decrease reliance on fossil fuels. As in many places, buildings are a big source of Flagstaff's greenhouse gases, mainly because many are heated by burning natural gas. But in February 2020, the Arizona Legislature blocked much of Flagstaff's plan for its buildings. With the backing of the state's main gas utility, the Legislature passed a bill that prevents municipalities and counties from banning new gas infrastructure and hookups. ""It definitely put a huge hurdle in our plans for promoting electrification and fuel switching,"" says Nicole Antonopoulos, Flagstaff's sustainability director. The Arizona law was a test case for a strategy the natural gas sector is now deploying nationwide. Gas utilities, with help from industry trade groups, have successfully lobbied lawmakers over the past year to introduce similar ""preemption"" legislation in 12 mostly Republican-controlled state legislatures, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). The speed and scale of the strategy show just how high the stakes are for the gas industry. According to internal reports and hundreds of recent emails obtained through public records requests and shared with NPR, the gas industry sees an existential threat in the efforts of cities, states, businesses — and now the Biden administration — to sharply reduce fossil fuel use. ""As you're really looking at what's going to come out of the Biden administration, they're really talking about remaking the entire economy through a green lens, and that means eliminating natural gas,"" Sue Forrester, vice president of advocacy and outreach at the American Gas Association (AGA), said during an industry conference last November. Gas utilities and their powerful lobby, the AGA, are racing on multiple fronts to convince lawmakers and the public that swapping out natural gas with electric would harm consumers and lead to higher bills. They argue that using natural gas is compatible with addressing climate change, despite scientific evidence to the contrary. Pro-gas groups have emerged around the country with names such as ""The Empowerment Alliance"" and ""Partnership for Energy Progress"" to sway local and state debates about electrification. The gas industry has launched ad campaigns on Facebook and Instagram touting gas as far better for cooking. Some industry lobbying and public relations campaigns have drawn the attention of regulators. In California, one case involved the group ""Californians For Balanced Energy Solutions"" (C4BES). The ratepayer advocate's office recommended that the country's biggest gas utility, SoCalGas, pay steep fines for improperly using ratepayer money to fund C4BES and oppose gas bans and energy efficiency measures, an allegation the company denies. ""In the broader context, this is reluctance to adapt to changing conditions. It's a reluctance to work with the community, the state government or federal government to identify solutions to address climate change,"" Antonopoulos says of the gas industry. ""If they keep spending energy on preemption laws, it will distract them from identifying solutions. And that's a missed opportunity."" ""Reframing the debate"" around natural gas State preemption laws help industries protect a particular market. These types of laws have long been used by other industries such as tobacco and plastic bag makers to kill local initiatives. While the AGA says it ""will absolutely oppose any effort to ban natural gas,"" President and CEO Karen Harbert says her group maintains an arm's length relationship with efforts to pass preemption laws. ""We are not coordinating these efforts and we are not state lobbyists,"" she tells NPR. ""We concentrate our activities, certainly, at the federal level."" That distinction is important because much of the AGA's budget comes from ratepayers through its member utilities. That means you, as a ratepayer, could be funding this work, even if you don't agree with it. But public documents reviewed by NPR and recordings of AGA executives reveal that the group is actively involved in passing state-level bills, along with utilities and local gas trade groups, that block critical local action to cut heat-trapping emissions. ""We have run pro-gas choice legislation [in] Arizona, Tennessee, Louisiana ... and Oklahoma. And so those states now, you have an option. You can't deny someone natural gas service in their home,"" the AGA's George Lowe told colleagues during an industry conference last November. Lowe, vice president of governmental affairs and public policy, said AGA member companies were eyeing 15 to 20 other states to pass similar bills this year. A March 2020 AGA slide presentation lists as a goal: ""To keep natural gas an integral part of a clean energy future by reframing the debate."" Under ""AGA initiatives,"" it states: ""Model and preemptive legislation — Introduced in AZ, TN, MN."" The recordings and documents from a public records request were obtained by the Climate Investigations Center, a nonpartisan environmental watchdog group, and shared with NPR. Harbert says gas utilities can be a part of solving the climate problem. ""If the goal is to reduce emissions, we're all in,"" she says. ""If the goal is to put us out of business, not so much."" Her industry is working on cleaner alternatives, including so-called renewable natural gas. It uses waste methane from landfills and manure, and it can be mixed with hydrogen to run through the existing gas utility pipeline network. ""We really have a very effective delivery system,"" she says. ""Whatever is going to go through that system — it could be today's molecules or it could be tomorrow's molecules."" Meanwhile, she says, the industry is growing. ""Natural gas utilities continue to expand and invest. We're adding a customer every minute of every day. That means about 600,000 new customers in 2021."" What the science requires Over the past decade, natural gas has been credited with reducing carbon dioxide emissions. But for humanity to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of climate change, most of the world's fossil fuels need to stay in the ground, scientists say. That includes nearly half of natural gas reserves. Greenhouse gas emissions hit record levels in 2019 because of the expanded use of natural gas, which not only emits carbon dioxide but can leak into the atmosphere from pipelines as methane, a far more potent heat-trapping gas. ""We cannot continue using natural gas for things like heating and cooking because it's not consistent with reaching a net-zero goal,"" says Erin Mayfield, a postdoctoral research associate at Princeton University. Mayfield co-authored a recent study into the most cost-effective ways to zero out greenhouse gas emissions. The study looked at five pathways to reach ""net-zero"" emissions by 2050. None of the pathways included gas utilities as they exist now. At net-zero, heat-trapping gases would no longer build up in the atmosphere because emissions would be so low that forests or technology could remove an equal amount of them. Other studies by the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the National Academy of Sciences echo Mayfield's conclusion: Electrifying the country's buildings, making appliances more efficient and powering them with renewable energy are among the best paths to cutting emissions. ""Electric heating can be totally clean ... if electric utilities deliver power made from solar and wind and hydro. Which many are promising to do,"" says Alejandra Mejia Cunningham, building decarbonization advocate at the NRDC. Cities versus states Buildings are a ripe target for greenhouse gas cuts, accounting for about 12% of the country's emissions. President Biden's ambitious climate plan includes a goal to cut the carbon footprint of buildings in half by 2035 through incentives to retrofit homes and businesses with electric appliances and furnaces. Many cities already are pushing ahead with electrification. By late January, 42 California cities had taken action to limit gas use in new buildings, according to the Sierra Club. More than a dozen of them have outright banned new buildings with gas hookups. Outside California, Salt Lake City hopes to get builders to forgo gas in new buildings through public outreach and financial incentives. Denver has a plan to electrify most buildings by 2027. About a year ago in Arizona, Antonopoulos says, Flagstaff was considering a gas ban. ""That was one of our strategies: Could we say, 'No gas in new construction?'"" she says. At that same time, the gas utility industry was preparing its counterattack. At a December 2019 meeting of the AGA's executive committee, Harbert called these moves by cities a new challenge to the industry. The AGA set a 2020 priority to ""expand efforts at the federal, state, and local levels to ensure policies, regulations and other initiatives include the option of natural gas for consumers and preserve customer choice of energy."" A few months later, in February 2020, Rep. Russell Bowers, the Republican speaker of Arizona's House of Representatives, introduced a bill blocking cities from restricting gas hookups. The bill had the backing of Southwest Gas, the state's largest gas utility, and Bowers had received $3,500 from the company for his 2020 reelection campaign. Republicans lined up to support the proposal. ""We have been able to observe what happens in cities like Berkeley, Calif., that take these radical steps to tell people, 'This is what you will use, whether you like it or not,'"" Rep. Mark Finchem of Tucson said during a floor debate. The bill sailed through the Legislature and was signed into law within a month. Flagstaff dropped efforts to ban new gas hookups and is trying to find other ways to get to net-zero carbon emissions. In 2020, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Louisiana also passed preemption laws. This year, 12 states have taken up preemption legislation so far, and the chances of it passing in several are high. They include: Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Texas and Utah. Many bills contain similar or even identical language. Proposed legislation in both Utah and Georgia, for instance, would block local governments from ""prohibiting the connection or reconnection of any utility service based upon the type or source of energy or fuel to be delivered to any customer."" ""I didn't dream this up,"" says state Rep. Stephen Handy, R-Utah, who introduced the bill in his state. ""I became aware of it, frankly, from my local natural gas supplier, Dominion."" ""We're a little bit worried"" City officials in states considering new bills now wonder what they'll be allowed to do if the bills pass. Jasmin Moore, sustainability director for Douglas County and the city of Lawrence, Kan., worries that her state's proposed law, which prohibits any municipal ordinance that ""discriminates against, restricts, limits, or impairs"" the use of utility service, might even ban city programs aimed at promoting energy efficiency, since that would reduce gas use. ""It really seems like it's intended to slow down our progress,"" Moore says. In Utah, Salt Lake City Sustainability Director Vicki Bennett says, ""We're a little bit worried about the legislation because it's very broad."" It's unclear, she says, whether the proposed law in Utah would allow a city to offer financial incentives to encourage developers to go all electric. Switching from gas to electric in existing homes can be expensive. But building new homes that are all electric can be cheaper than constructing homes with gas hookups. ""You eliminate gas taps, you eliminate running all those gas lines through your building,"" says Tyler Hollon, sustainability director for Wadman Corp., a construction company in Utah. Hollon says his company did its first all-electric building because an environmentally minded developer, Giv Group, demanded it. Wadman's executives thought it would cost a lot extra, but they were wrong. At the two companies' latest collaboration, a six-story affordable housing project in Salt Lake City, there are efficient electric heat pumps instead of gas furnaces in each unit. Heat pumps also deliver hot water. Hollon's company shares its blueprints and budgets with other builders. ""We just want everybody to do it. It's everybody's air that we're all breathing,"" Hollon says. ""Makes my mountain bike ride that much easier."" The future of gas The AGA's Harbert warns that it's shortsighted to eliminate gas from the country's energy picture. ""The narrative that has been set now is that we are actually the fuel of yesterday and we don't feel that that's the case. We believe that we're the opportunity for tomorrow,"" Harbert says. She says abandoning gas utility infrastructure and building out the electricity grid would be expensive, something researchers with the Princeton study considered before concluding that electrification would still be necessary to keep global warming at safer levels. Ratepayer advocates share some of the gas industry's concerns. Stefanie Brand, director for the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel, says a benefit of having both electricity and gas in homes is that people can still get some services when the power goes out. ""A lot of people can cook. ... And a lot of people can have hot water. But think about it, when everybody drives an electric car ..."" Brand says you might not be able to drive anywhere when a storm knocks out the grid in your neighborhood. Still, Brand says she understands that the country needs to reduce fossil fuel consumption and move toward more renewable energy to address climate change. That's why she also concludes that gas utilities may not be able to stay in business. ""I do think they're going to be around for a while,"" Brand says, ""but I don't think they're going to be around forever.""","As Cities Grapple With Climate Change, Gas Utilities Fight To Stay In Business"

Chunks of sticky, black tar began washing up late last week. On Sunday, Israel's Environmental Protection Ministry warned people to avoid going to beaches from the country's northern border with Lebanon all the way to the south near the Gaza Strip. Tar exposure can make people sick and irritate the skin. More than 4,000 volunteers from the Israeli nonprofit group EcoOcean have helped remove tar from beaches so far, according to the ministry. The Israel Nature and Parks Authority warned that the ""consequences will be seen for years to come."" Israeli environmental minister Gila Gamliel said Saturday that there are no more oil slicks visible off Israel's coast, ""which is an encouraging condition."" However the ministry warned that large waves are forecast this week. The waves could carry chunks of sticky tar from beach to beach, complicating cleanup efforts. Israeli and European authorities are investigating what happened. Israeli officials believe a ship spilled tens or even hundreds of tons of oil in the Mediterranean, beyond the country's territorial waters. The spill likely happened about a week ago, when stormy weather affected the region. It's unclear which ship or ships are responsible. Israeli authorities are working with European officials to review satellite images of ships that passed through the area. The European Union monitors the location of oil slicks in the Mediterranean using information from a network of weather satellites. When ships release oil into the water, much of the oil pools at the surface and is carried great distances by currents. Scientists can use ocean current and weather data to reverse engineer the source of the tar that washed up along Israel's coastline. Gamliel said Saturday that the ministry had zeroed in on fewer than a dozen ships, and was attempting to narrow it down further in the coming days, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. The tar pollution has already affected wildlife. Volunteers rushed to rescue sea birds, turtles and fish that were covered in oily residue or had ingested oil. Israel's National Sea Turtle Rescue Center confirmed that it was treating multiple turtles covered in tar. One species that has ecologists particularly worried is a reef-building snail called Dendropoma petraeum. As the Mediterranean Sea heats up due to global warming, the snail's population on the Israeli coast has plummeted. That makes the species particularly vulnerable to other ecological disasters.

2,https://www.npr.org/2021/02/21/969527300/ropeless-lobster-fishing-could-save-the-whales-could-it-kill-the-industry,NPR,Centrist,"After three decades of fishing for lobsters in Cape Cod Bay in Massachusetts, Rob Martin knows his boat inside and out. ""It's only 40 feet. It was big when I first got it and now it seems small,"" he says while warming up inside the cabin on a cold morning. Just as Cape Cod lobstermen have done for centuries, Martin used to check his traps by looking for buoys connected to cages on the ocean floor by ropes. But his buoys are gone and he is one of a handful of Massachusetts lobstermen testing ropeless fishing systems. ""Everything's ready to go,"" he calls out as the boat idles about a half-mile outside the Cape Cod Canal, near where he last dropped his traps. With one hand Martin reaches for a pair of waterproof overalls and with the other he grabs his iPhone to open an app that sends acoustic signals to his traps 50 feet underwater. ""I'm hitting the release command,"" he explains. ""Release!"" In seconds, the app lets out two quick beeps confirming that somewhere down below an air tank inside a trap is inflating a balloon that lifts the trap to the surface. Martin looks out across the water quietly, waiting for something to appear. ""Oh! There it is,"" he says as a long bright-orange balloon pops out of the water, resembling one of those blow-up tubes dancing outside of a car dealership. By using this technology, Martin eliminates the need to use vertical ropes which can be deadly for North Atlantic right whales diving for food. Rope entanglement is a leading cause of death for the mammals that can weigh as much as 70 tons. In fact, more than 85% of right whales have been entangled in fishing gear at least once, the majority multiple times, according to a report from the New England Aquarium. Today, with an estimated 370 North Atlantic right whales remaining, the species is classified by the IUCN Red List as critically endangered, one step from extinction. To save the whales from the brink, state authorities have instituted seasonal fishing closures in waters off New England. More protections from the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration, which some fishermen consider burdensome, are still pending. Conservationists hope that fishermen like Rob Martin can prove ropeless fishing can save both the whales and the lobster industry. Many lobstermen, though, say they prefer the closures to the technological leap they would have to make to adopt ropeless fishing. ""The technology is just like ... we're at the Model T today and people expect us to be at the Tesla tomorrow,"" explains Beth Casoni, who is executive director of the Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association. She also says the cost is prohibitive — switching to ropeless gear could cost a single fisherman up to $70,000. Another major concern is safety. Without buoys on the surface marking where lobster gear is located underwater, fishing boats that drag nets along the seafloor can get caught on lobstermen's traps. Ropeless technology manufacturers said they're still working on developing a shared app so fishermen have a clear picture of trap locations on the ocean floor. Casoni says that's necessary before her association will seriously consider going ropeless. ""We need a large-scale, scientific, unbiased feasibility study on the whole thing,"" Casoni says. ""We need to put five boats out in a big square, fishing ropeless, mobile gear, and see what really happens."" Despite these challenges, Martin says he wants to continue his federally-funded tests. After all, he has been catching lobsters using the new technology. ""That's a female with eggs,"" he says pointing to the underbelly of one of the lobsters that came up in a trap. ""[It] has to be thrown back."" Martin understands the stakes: If right whales keep dying at current rates, the species could reach a point in the next 20 years from which it can't recover. And if regulators shut down the entire lobster fishery in order to save the whales, lobstermen could face their own kind of extinction.",'Ropeless' Lobster Fishing Could Save The Whales.

3,https://www.npr.org/2021/02/19/969387323/u-s-officially-rejoins-paris-agreement-on-climate-change,NPR,Centrist,"The United States on Friday officially rejoined the Paris Agreement on climate change designed to limit global warming and avoid its potentially catastrophic impacts. Nearly 200 nations have signed on to the landmark accord and committed to limit their greenhouse gas emissions in an attempt to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius - preferably below 1.5 degrees Celsius - compared to pre-industrial temperatures. ""The Paris Agreement is an unprecedented framework for global action. We know because we helped design it and make it a reality,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. ""Its purpose is both simple and expansive: to help us all avoid catastrophic planetary warming and to build resilience around the world to the impacts from climate change we already see."" Rejoining the Paris Agreement was one of President Biden's top priorities. Only hours after taking the oath of office, he signed an executive order initiating a 30-day process to reenter the pact. The Biden administration will make climate change a key component of its foreign policy, weaving it into its most important bilateral and multilateral conversations, Blinken said. ""Climate change and science diplomacy can never again be 'add-ons' in our foreign policy discussions. Addressing the real threats from climate change and listening to our scientists is at the center of our domestic and foreign policy priorities. It is vital in our discussions of national security, migration, international health efforts, and in our economic diplomacy and trade talks,"" he said. The U.S. left the Paris Agreement in November after a yearlong waiting period had ended. Former President Donald Trump originally announced his intention to withdraw from the treaty in 2017 and formally notified the United Nations in 2019. Under the terms of the agreement, the U.S. promised to reduce its emissions by about 25% by 2025 compared with 2005 levels. But according to analysts, the country is only on track to achieve about a 17% reduction. On Thursday, White House adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall said the extreme winter weather conditions in Texas and many other states across the central and southern United States this week are a reminder that climate change is real. In 2020, there have already been 16 climate-driven disasters that cost at least $1 billion each, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. No other country has emitted more cumulative carbon dioxide into the atmosphere since the industrial era began in the mid-1800s than the United States. And even though U.S. emissions are falling, the rate of the reduction is far too slow to avoid catastrophic warming, according to climate scientists. That's in part because the Trump administration rolled back carbon pollution limits from power plants, cars, trucks and fossil fuel operations. American emissions rose slightly in the first two years of the Trump administration. Despite the former administration's numerous rollbacks of environmental regulations, many American cities, states and companies have vowed to drastically reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the coming years. Twelve states and at least 165 U.S. cities have plans to get 100% of their electricity from renewable sources, according to the climate tracking group America's Pledge. While adapting to climate change is expensive, there's also evidence it can be good for the economy. Between 2005 and 2017, 41 states increased their gross domestic product while reducing carbon dioxide emissions, according to a recent analysis by the World Resources Institute think tank. Also, investment in clean energy generates more jobs than investing in fossil fuels due to clean energy's more labor-intensive nature, according to the WRI.",U.S. Officially Rejoins Paris Agreement On Climate Change

At first glance, it might appear as if all they had in common was age, but there was more. They were both growing up in religious households — she a Baptist in a walled community outside of Los Angeles, he a Muslim in suburban Maryland. And they shared a burning desire to understand the constantly evolving, confusing world they occupied. The boy was me. The girl, Lauren Oya Olamina, is, of course, the main character in Octavia Butler's classic science fiction novel Parable of the Sower. We were introduced by an adventurous middle school English teacher who assigned the book to my class. In Butler's dystopian world, a strongman has risen to power in the United States, and climate change is decimating the environment. The economy is falling apart. Income inequality is out of control. Resources are scarce, and violence has forced people to isolate. The year is 2024. Lauren was born with a disorder that makes her feel extreme empathy. She feels everyone's pain. It exhausts her. As a sensitive teen myself, I felt I understood Lauren. And I felt connected to the author who created her. I have found myself returning to Parable of the Sower and Butler's other writings many times over the years to help make sense of things, to find in her stories lessons to guide my own life. And in 2016, a year of significant change in the world and my life, as I entered fatherhood and embarked on an entirely new career, I reached with more urgency for Parable of the Sower. The novel offers a dystopian warning that if we, the human race, continue along our current path, then unimaginable horrors await us. But, in truth, such a narrow interpretation is a mistake. It misses the invitation to embrace the essential message of Butler's work, that the only constant life has ever offered us is change. Octavia Estelle Butler was born in Pasadena, Calif., in 1947. As a child, she experienced debilitating shyness. She spent hours in the local library, escaping into fantasy and science fiction novels. Butler was 12 when saw a film, Devil Girl from Mars, and thought to herself, ""I could write something better than that."" And so it began. Butler's obsession with writing deepened over the years. As a young woman, she would get up at 2 a.m. every day to write before working jobs like dishwasher and potato chip inspector. It wasn't until she was in her 30s that Butler was able to support herself financially as a writer. She published a series of very popular novels, including Kindred and Wild Seed, in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Then came Parable of the Sower in 1993. The book was a smash hit, and just two years later, at the age of 48, she was awarded the MacArthur Fellowship ""Genius Grant."" The worlds Butler imagined drew from her reading of history and her upbringing. Raised in a strict Baptist household, she was always fascinated by the impact of religion on the human mind. She had a complicated relationship with the traditions she grew up in as a Black woman from a religious family. Lauren's character embodied this tension. She, like Butler, is raised a Baptist. But as a young woman, she develops a religious philosophy called Earthseed based on the idea that  ""God is Change."" It is a philosophy dedicated to the idea that all living things are evolving and the only way to survive is to embrace the central paradox of existence — that we are all evolving, yet we will all die. Like Butler, Lauren eventually attracts followers to her vision. We meet her in the book as a person filled with imperfections, before her transformation to a prophet in the minds of Earthseed believers. Maybe, in a way, this was Butler seeing into the future of her own legacy where people like me, impacted deeply by her writing as a child, would one day reflect on her impact, her purpose. What Butler saw in our future matters more today than ever. She saw a world headed toward collapse. She saw a Black, female prophet who understood that nothing was inevitable, that we have the power to change things and change course. On some level, as a 13-year-old, I understood that Butler's work was not just a warning but also an invitation. It invites us to let go of the conventions that can lock us into a destructive future and to embrace our greatest power, to change. She introduces us to a humanist vision for the future that makes space for metaphysical spirituality without the need for a traditional, omnipotent God-figure. Butler, who died in 2006 at age 58. is remembered as one of the greatest American science fiction writers. As we celebrate Black History Month, we should also remember her as a prophetic visionary like so many before her. She imagined worlds like the one we are living in, but encouraged each of us to dream our own dreams and to respond to the fear of uncertainty with creativity and bravery.

Greg Abbott declared reform of the group that manages the state's power grid to be an emergency item for the legislature to take on during its current session. An investigation is needed to prevent more such outages, Abbott said. ""The Electric Reliability Council of Texas has been anything but reliable over the past 48 hours,"" Abbott said. ""Far too many Texans are without power and heat for their homes as our state faces freezing temperatures and severe winter weather. This is unacceptable."" The governor said he wants to ""get a full picture of what caused this problem and find long-term solutions."" Roughly 4.4 million customers were without electricity as of midday Tuesday in Texas, according to the tracking site PowerOutage.us. On the same day, many cities in Texas and neighboring states are seeing record low temperatures, such as -1 in Dallas-Fort Worth, 12 in San Antonio and 19 in Corpus Christi — erasing marks that had stood for more than 100 years. Electricity customers across Texas have been enduring rolling blackouts since the early hours of Monday morning, after the state's grid operator rapidly escalated an energy emergency declaration through three levels early Monday. ERCOT, which manages power for about 90% of the state's electric load, said severe conditions were causing problems for all types of power generators, from natural gas to wind and solar. ""Every grid operator and every electric company is fighting to restore power right now,"" ERCOT's president and CEO, Bill Magness, said. Faced with a combination of electric grid failures and bitter cold, utilities and government officials in Texas are telling people who lack power to report to warming centers. Stunning price increases across the state Dire messages are coming from electricity retailers that normally offer customers low prices based on daily wholesale rates. With those rates now skyrocketing, companies are telling customers to brace for sticker shock. And at least one firm is urging its customers to switch to another provider, for at least the short term. ""Elevated prices are expected to continue till the end of the week,"" the provider Griddy told customers. As that picture came into focus over the weekend, Griddy published a guide to help customers switch to another retail provider to avoid steep price hikes. But people who want to switch to a new energy provider might have a hard time finding one right away. ""The soonest possible start date for a new enrollment or switch is Saturday, February 20,"" Cirro Energy says. Other providers, including Reliant, are citing the same date for accepting any new accounts. In contrast to a market-rate firm such as Griddy, companies like Cirro and Reliant promise bills that aren't as vulnerable to sudden increases that result from high demand. They also let customers sign up for bills that are averaged over time, dulling price spikes and making expenses more predictable. But for now, like much of Texas, they're overwhelmed by a blast of arctic air. Until recently, the average price for electricity in Texas was a bit more than 12 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Even before the storm's full effects were felt, Griddy warned its customers on Friday that prices rose to an average of around 30 cents per kilowatt-hour. Things got even worse over the weekend and the Presidents Day holiday. With demand high and market pressures raising costs, wholesale power prices ""were more than $9,000 per megawatt hour late Monday morning, compared with pre-storm prices of less than $50 per megawatt hour,"" Reuters reported. A megawatt-hour is equal to 1,000 kilowatt-hours. On average, a U.S. residential utility customer normally uses about 877 kWh each month, according to the EIA. As the cost of electricity soared, Griddy advised its customers to switch. ""We want what's right by our consumers, so we are encouraging them to leave,"" Griddy CEO Michael Fallquist told Bloomberg News. ""We believe that transparency and that honesty will bring them back"" after the emergency passes, he added. Utilities and power companies are also urging people to cut their energy use, asking them to set their thermostats no higher than 68 degrees and to minimize their use of appliances. They're also asking people to close their shades and blinds to reduce heat loss through windows. The rotating blackouts include ""customers who had power restored previously"" during the winter storm, says Garland Power & Light, northeast of Dallas. Uneven impact by necessity, say energy providers Within service areas, the blackouts aren't affecting all neighborhoods equally — a phenomenon that has drawn criticism from customers but one that energy providers say is tied to the need to keep power flowing at critical-need facilities such as hospitals, water plants and emergency services. ""The parts of our service area experiencing outages are based on the status of the circuit they're on,"" Austin Energy says. ""Areas with power likely share a circuit with a critical load circuit"" that includes a hospital or other essential facility. In a normal emergency, Austin Energy says, ""we rotate outages throughout our service area. Unfortunately, we are unable to rotate outages at this time because there are no other available non-critical load circuits to put into outage rotation."" The best course now, the company adds, is for customers who have power to conserve it as utilities and power generators work to restore capacity. ""The number of controlled outages we have to do remains high,"" said Dan Woodfin, ERCOT's senior director of system operations. He added, ""We are optimistic that we will be able to reduce the number throughout the day."" The operator and energy providers are also warning customers that they should get their homes ready for power to be turned back on, mainly by unplugging appliances and turning off the thermostat. ""Too much load on restored circuits at once can cause another outage,"" ERCOT says.",Texas Governor Calls For Investigation Into Group That Manages State Power Grid

But defenders of those forests have just deployed a new tool in their struggle to stop it — or at least alert the world when it's happening. It's an upgrade of a system called Global Forest Watch, created by the World Resources Institute. The website makes it possible to monitor what's happening to distant tropical forests almost in real time through satellite imagery. Mikaela Weisse, who helps run this site, demonstrates how it works. She zooms in on one small area of the Central African Republic. It looks a bit like Google Maps, except that this map is updated constantly. Behind the scenes, computers sift through a flood of images collected from satellites, day by day, using techniques devised by researchers at the University of Maryland and Wageningen University in the Netherlands. When the software detects a change - when trees have disappeared from a particular spot since the satellite last looked at it — it issues an alert, and a color-coded spot shows up on the map where trees appear to have vanished. The satellites revisit each spot on the globe about once a week. ""If we can detect deforestation and other changes as soon as they're happening,"" Weisse says, ""then there's the possibility to send in law enforcement or what have you, to stop it before it goes further."" There's some evidence  the monitoring works, she says. According to one study, in places where people know they're being watched, there's been less forest clearing. The system has had one big problem, though. When it's raining, or cloudy, regular satellite sensors can't see the forest. And in the tropics, it rains a lot. ""In Indonesia, my impression is, it's the rainy season almost all the time."" Weisse says. ""There's almost always cloud cover."" That means deforestation doesn't come to light until weeks or even months later, when the weather clears. And Weisse says some loggers or ranchers have taken advantage of that, clearing land during rainy times of the year. Last month, though, Weisse and her colleagues unveiled something new. Their system now collects images from an additional kind of satellite sensor, using radar, which sees right through clouds. ""Essentially, the satellites are sending radio waves to Earth and collecting how they come back,"" she says. The instrument is operated by the European Space Agency, and it delivers even sharper pictures than what Global Forest Watch had been getting. ""We can actually see these little patches that indicate where there's been removal of a single tree,"" Weisse says. At that site in the Central African Republic, in front of her on the computer, the map shows dark pink lines and blotches where trees disappeared just within the past few weeks. Anybody in the world can log in and see this. So local environmentalists, or even big food companies that have pledged not to buy crops grown on deforested land, can react more quickly.",Pillagers Of Tropical Forests Can't Hide Behind Clouds Anymore

Then again, most rural towns this size probably haven't had the steady pipeline of tax revenue from natural gas pumped off nearby federal land to pay for it. The opening of the center, more than a decade ago, convinced its now director Amber Anderson to move back home after college in 2018 as a young professional. ""I would not have come back to Pinedale had it not been for this facility, and my family's all here and I love the outdoors and stuff but there just wasn't a lot to offer in Pinedale,"" says Anderson. The Jonah Field is one of the most productive federal drilling lands in the country. But in the last few years, things have gotten tough. When prices were high, companies drilled a lot, but now there's a glut. Prices tanked and the pandemic has made that even worse. Locally, people are getting laid off, and Anderson recently had to cut the aquatic center's budget by almost half. ""It's kind of scary, living in that,"" she says. ""Some diversification would probably be a positive thing."" Calls to diversify The Biden administration's new climate agenda is forcing a reckoning for states that are dependent on fossil fuels, like Wyoming. Much of its economy — and its state budget — is built on exporting coal, oil and gas to the rest of America. The state is now expected to sue over President Biden's ban on new oil and gas leasing on federal land. Wyoming's history is one of wild swings between booms and busts, but some have been saying that the state needs to diversify for decades. ""The money is so good, that people's eyes just glaze over,"" says Linda Baker, an environmental activist in Pinedale who also spent five years working in the oil patch. For Baker, the latest bust feels different though. Wyoming, the least populated state in the US, is on the financial brink, and now the Biden administration is trying to wean the country off fossil fuels due to the climate crisis. ""We have a little breathing room to establish alternative energy sources throughout Wyoming,"" she says. It will be tough, she suggests, even without the influence of politics. While the state is developing renewable energy, it's currently only a fraction of the tax revenue that fossil fuels bring in. Economists say you'd have to increase wind energy production by 100 times just to match what Wyoming currently brings in from coal alone. State lawmakers are poised to make draconian cuts to state services, with public schools bearing the brunt at up to a forecasted $100 million in losses. ""It's time that we really face up to these facts,"" said Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon at a press conference late last year. ""Without improvements in our revenue picture these cuts will most likely be permanent."" 'Draconian' budget cuts The governor recently directed the state's lone university to partner with community colleges to modernize workforce training and diversify the economy. But a few days later, he also ordered state agencies to report what the financial impacts of President Biden's leasing ban will be, indicating he'll sue the White House. Joel Bousman, a commissioner in Sublette County, which includes Pinedale, fears the worst from that new executive order. ""This is happening so fast,"" Bousman says. About 90% of all of Sublette County's budget comes from taxes on fossil fuels. And he wishes the new administration would have signaled a willingness for more dialogue and a slow 'winding down' of drilling. Instead, he says, the new leasing moratorium was handed down in the first few days after President Biden took office. ""There has been no information whatsoever coming out of the federal government to say, you know, we're thinking of a moratorium,"" Bousman says. Industry scaling back But even before the ban, companies were scaling back from drilling in western towns like Pinedale, if not pulling out all together because it's cheaper to do business on private land in states like Texas or North Dakota. A few years ago, a truck stop near the Jonah Field would have been humming with roughnecks, company bosses, and gas well maintenance crews. Instead, it's been mostly deserted for months, says the manager, Roxanne Kroeger. She is trying to work out how much longer she can hold on: ""It's very uncertain, nobody knows what's going to happen, now that President Biden's in there."" Biden is pledging to retrain and support traditional fossil fuels workers in states like Wyoming during the transition. Meanwhile, an editorial in Wyoming's largest newspaper pleaded that the country not turn its back on Wyoming workers, especially after all the cheap energy that's been produced and exported out of here for decades. The possibility of a transition is forcing a question that even just a few years ago might have been considered unthinkable: What is Wyoming without fossil fuels? Thinking 'outside the box' ""The state faces financial ruin,"" says Justin Farrell, who grew up in Cheyenne and is now a sociology professor at Yale. ""In times past it could get by on coal, oil, natural gas production, but those are just not attractive markets any longer."" Farrell's recent book, Billionaire Wilderness, exposes one big new market in Wyoming: luxury real estate. The ultra wealthy are moving to resort areas like Jackson Hole drawn by their beauty, but also their tax shelters. There's no state income or corporate income tax and pretty lax residency requirements. ""Wyoming is happy to tax these similar billion dollar industries like oil and gas,"" says Farewell. ""Why won't they tax this new billion dollar luxury real estate?"" This migration trend has only accelerated during the pandemic, and it has spread to places near Jackson, like Pinedale. ""It is going to require that the state reinvent itself again,"" says Pinedale Mayor Matt Murdock. He is trying to push his home state to think outside the box if fossil fuels really are on their way out. Recently, he started an alternative energy company that aims to recycle waste from landfills or even old defunct oil wells and turn it into gas. ""Change has always challenged the status quo,"" Murdock says. ""So we need to do our best to try to steward that and try to direct the change in a way that helps people to make the shift.""","Facing A Reckoning, Wyoming Wrestles With A Transition From Fossil Fuels"

A 2020 report from Global Witness, an international human rights group, documented that 212 environmental and land activists were murdered in 2019. Over half of those murders took place in Colombia and the Philippines, countries where intensive mining and agribusiness have transformed the environment. Both countries also face the intensifying impacts of climate change. The activists most at-risk are those with close connections to the land: subsistence farmers, tribal leaders, lawyers, and organizers, who speak out against environmental and human rights abuses. The United Nations calls these individuals ""environmental defenders."" In the last 20 years, Global Witness has recorded a surge in the number of murders and attacks on environmental activists, in addition to discriminatory laws and practices that criminalize environmental activism, or intimidate those who speak out. Moreover, these murders disproportionately impact indigenous communities. In Colombia, indigenous groups account for 4.4% of the population — yet half of the documented killings in 2019 targeted an indigenous Colombian. Colombia and the Philippines have distinct political histories and armed actors driving this violence, but the relationship between violence and industry is worrisome.

The race for the prize – the largest in the XPrize's history – will start on Earth Day and will run for four years, through 2025. Winning entries will need to show an ability for their idea to scale up to gigaton levels, a benchmark that refers to a billion metric tons of carbon. For the last several years, the world's energy-related CO2 emissions have topped 30 gigatons. The goal, XPrize says, is to tackle ""the biggest threat facing humanity — fighting climate change and rebalancing Earth's carbon cycle. "" XPrize announced the new competition on Monday, more than a month after Musk said on Twitter that he planned to donate $100 million to create ""a prize for best carbon capture technology."" At the time, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO cited the need for large-scale removal of carbon, saying, ""For now, by far the top priority is accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy economy."" Carbon capture is a longstanding idea that's seen as easing costs and other pressures during the move away from carbon-based fossil fuels and toward renewable energy. But it has been criticized on two fronts. On one hand, some environmental groups call it a tactic for corporations or governments to counterbalance rather than reduce their emissions — including from fossil fuels such as coal. On the other hand, people who agree that the concept holds promise also acknowledge that the underlying technology is drastically undeveloped. The new XPrize aims to close the technology gap by spurring innovation. Its backers say they're concerned the world won't be able to prevent global warming by relying solely on cutting emissions. ""For humanity to reach the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting the Earth's temperature rise to no more than 1.5˚(C) of pre-industrial levels, or even 2˚(C), we need bold, radical tech innovation and scale up that goes beyond limiting CO2 emissions,"" the organization says. The top prizes include $50 million for the overall winner, along with $20 million for second place and $10 million for third. But many other groups could also get important funding and support, including 25 student teams that will vie for $200,000 in scholarships, according to the XPrize announcement. Teams will be able to register for the competition on April 22. Some 18 months later, a panel of judges will select 15 teams to receive $1 million each, based on the strength of their submissions. XPrize will issue full guidelines and other details about the competition in April.

How about a factory and a forest? What separates the environments that ""nature"" builds and the ones we humans build? While this might have been an abstract question for philosophers at one point, it's not anymore. Decades into what is appropriately called ""the climate crisis,"" humans are now facing down a planet that has been profoundly changed by our collective activities. In our struggle to find a response, and hopefully save ourselves, the relationship between humans and nature is being reconstructed. That ongoing reconstruction is the focus of Elizabeth Kolbert's new book Under A White Sky: The Nature of the Future. And, as she shows us, it's a project that's neither clear, clean or certain. Kolbert is well-known as the best-selling author of The Sixth Extinction. Her reporting brought the ongoing mass-extinction event that we're inadvertently causing now from talk in scientific literature to common knowledge. In this new book, Kolbert once again looks down the barrel of the Anthropocene, the new geologic epoch where human activity represents the most powerful force shaping the machinery of Earth's planetary evolution. Early in the book, Kolbert lists the startling facts of this new Anthropocene Earth: The consequence of the extraordinary power we're exerting on the Earth is that the planet is changing. It's sliding out of the state we found it in 10,000 years ago when the last ice age ended. But this new planet seems like it's going to be a lot less hospitable to our ""project of civilization"" than the one we've started with. In response to this sobering fact, communities across the world are trying to shift from inadvertent impacts on the natural world to conscious and intentional control. Kolbert's book is, essentially, reporting from the front lines of these frenzied efforts. Under A White Sky is broken into three parts. The first, Down The River, tells two stories: The first is the effort to manage and control fish populations associated with rivers in the Midwest. The story is really about the Chicago River but, as Kolbert takes pains to show, the big problem in managing the Anthropocene is that everything is connected to everything else. A species like silver carp introduced into an Arkansas pond may eventually find their way to taking over lakes in Illinois. In the second part of the section, Kolbert tells of the equally complicated effort to deal with the drowning of Louisiana's Mississippi River delta which, itself, is a consequence of the last century's vast effort to tame that same river. The second section of the book, Into The Wild, details the attempts to save species and ecosystems from our impacts — while the third, Up In The Air, tells the story of ""geoengineering,"" where global warming is countered not by reducing fossil fuels but by literally rewiring the atmosphere. As Kolbert shows, the lurking, unintended consequences geoengineering can be pretty frightening. One plan to cool the planet by spraying tiny sunlight-reflecting particles high into the air would turn the sky from blue to white. What unites Kolbert's reporting in all these stories is the sense of scale that comes with the problems we face targeting a reasonable outcome for our Anthropocene — a ""good Anthropocene"" as some call it. For more than a decade, I have been thinking about the Anthropocene from my astronomer's perspective; this means I see it from a 10,000-light-year view where it appears as planetary transition much like the other huge transformations Earth and its life have gone through before. What was so illuminating about Kolbert's writing was to see planetary transformation brought down to the human scale. Reaching a good Anthropocene, if such a thing exists, would only happen as a result of millions of people in millions of communities doing experiments. They will be trying millions of ways to alter, adjust and adjudicate the natural processes we already altered by mistake. With considerable humor, Kolbert shows us just how fraught that project will be. What makes Under A White Sky so valuable and such a compelling read is Kolbert tells by showing. Without beating the reader over the head, she makes it clear how far we already are from a world of undisturbed, perfectly balanced nature — and how far we must still go to find a new balance for the planet's future that still has us humans in it.

It's a place she's always considered home, and where her grandmother still lives. So Price, an urban planner, was upset to learn about a lesser-known aspect of climate change fueled by sea level rise: it could cause the groundwater beneath this formerly-industrial community to rise, and wreak slow-motion havoc in the process. ""How is that going to affect my family?"" Price thought. ""And my community and the assets that we worked so hard to hold?"" For many Bay Area residents who live near the water's edge, little-publicized research indicates groundwater rising beneath their feet could start to manifest in 10-15 years, particularly in low-lying communities like Oakland. And that could resurface toxic substances that have lingered for years underground. ""Everything human beings use, they spill,"" says Kristina Hill, an associate professor at UC Berkeley's College of Environmental Design, who researches adapting urban areas and shoreline communities to climate change. The overflow includes ""everything we've used in the last hundred and fifty years."" That's a lot of things in the Bay Area, which is rife with industrial sites new and old. In East Oakland, industry boomed in the early 1900s as lumber yards, canneries, rail depots and foundries sprung up. It was a long time before governments enacted major environmental regulations, starting in the 1960s. ""Through the entire postwar and World War II-era, stuff got dumped informally,"" Hill says. More recent contaminants lie buried as well, chemicals like benzene and toluene, leaked from underground storage tanks. Many toxic sites now considered to be contained could pose a threat as the water ascends. ""Legacy contamination in the soil will be remobilized when the water table comes up and intersects with these areas of contaminated soil,"" Hill says. If the groundwater flows into contaminants no longer monitored because they are considered contained, those toxic substances may start to move unnoticed. That contaminated groundwater could seep into a basement or crawlspace beneath a home, or sneak in through a broken sewage line. Some of these chemicals vaporize, so humans could breathe them in. A recent report by Silvestrum Climate Associates, a private environmental consulting firm, found this could affect communities with a mile of the Bay Area coast. Hill and her colleagues have analyzed data and found the water below someone's backyard is typically within 6 feet of the surface of the ground, and often just 1-2 feet below the surface. ""It's possible that you have contamination in that water and you might not see it or smell it. You might not know,"" says Alec Naugle, who heads the toxics cleanup division for the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board. The agency regulates the mitigation of contaminated sites in a large area stretching over the nine Bay Area counties. ""If you're exposed to these chemicals over a lifetime, they can increase your risk of cancer,"" Naugle says. ""Some of those chemicals also have short-term risks at much higher concentrations that we don't typically see in the environment."" Many neighborhoods most at risk have large Black and Latino populations who already deal with unequal environmental health burdens due to living near major freeways and, in Oakland, a sizeable port. Residents of East and West Oakland have high rates of asthma, and children in East Oakland are more than twice as likely to suffer from the condition than their peers across Alameda County. Hill says it's no coincidence that large numbers of people of color live in low-lying areas that will likely face the threat of rising groundwater first. ""There was either redlining or restrictive homeowner covenants that prevented people of color from moving to neighborhoods on higher ground,"" she says. Regulators assess next moves Naugle, from the Water Quality Control Board, says contaminated sites are at risk of flooding all along California shorelines. ""There are literally hundreds, perhaps thousands of these cases in our region alone, not to mention statewide,"" he says. He and his team now face the daunting task of what to do, and where to do it first. Over the next few years, Silvestrum Climate Associates will map groundwater depths and test for contamination in four Bay Area counties. Naugle and his water board colleagues plan to use that data to identify the most urgent locations. California's Department of Toxic Substances Control plans to tackle the problem as well. Grant Cope, deputy director for site mitigation and restoration, would like to work with the U.S. Geological Survey to overlay maps that show groundwater rise onto maps of contaminated sites. That could serve as ""an early-warning system"" for site managers. In the meantime, Hill of UC Berkeley suggests residents request a monitoring well to track groundwater levels at nearby locations of concern, especially if they live downhill from former industrial sites like dry cleaners, gas stations or factories. Californians can also review sites known to contain contaminants through GeoTracker, an online database where various regulators track cleanup efforts. Cope says people can also lobby local governments to ""pass enforceable standards that apply to groundwater rise due to sea level rise."" He says that means groundwater rise must be taken into account when new buildings are planned, or when toxic sites are cleaned up. Urban planner Marquita Price wants to make people in her East Oakland community aware of this looming threat. A low-lying affordable housing development, Coliseum Gardens, sits on the location of a former recycling center, ringed by old industrial sites. She says residents notice flooding, but not many realize ""exactly what it is, and how contaminated it is, and how damaging it really could be."" Price also wants her community to have a role in addressing the problem. ""I don't want just some outside consultants and companies to come in and carry out the plan,"" she says. ""Our unemployment is crazy out here. So this could definitely be a low-entry job that can provide to the community.""","Near Coasts, Rising Seas Could Also Push Up Long-Buried Toxic Contamination"

It's the question at the heart of a landmark new report commissioned by the British government to evaluate the economic cost of continued environmental devastation. The Review on the Economics of Biodiversity, totaling more than 600 pages and issued Tuesday, frames nature as a financial asset that provides humanity with food, water, shelter and ""spiritual fulfillment."" Helmed by Cambridge University economist Sir Partha Dasgupta, the study argues that nature's contributions to global productivity should be quantified and, in essence, repaid.  That would require a dramatic reimagining of how countries assess economic performance. ""Truly sustainable economic growth and development means recognising that our long-term prosperity relies on rebalancing our demand of nature's goods and services with its capacity to supply them,"" Dasgupta said in a statement accompanying the report's release. Historically, nations have used gross domestic product as the central measure of economic health. It includes the total monetary value of all the goods and services produced by a country within a given period of time. But critics, including the report's authors, say that GDP fails to account for certain costs, including the degradation of the environment. And in ignoring those costs, the metric can obscure the risks that damage poses to future economic growth. The Economics of Biodiversity report instead calls for national and corporate accounting systems to estimate the value of ""natural capital"" and compensate nature for what it provides through investment in environmental stewardship. It is a system that would allow, among other things, growing economies to be compensated for preserving ecosystems like the Amazon and Congo Basin that are essential to human life. The report frames this as a sustainable alternative to extracting natural resources to fund near-term development at the expense long-term health. ""To put it simply, the state of the planet is broken,"" said United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at a recent conference on biodiversity loss. ""Humanity is waging war on nature. This is suicidal."" To maintain our current consumption of the planet's natural resources, the world's population would need 1.6 Earths, according to Global Footprint Network, a nonprofit that tracks human demands on the planet's increasingly fractured ecosystems. The extraction and use of those resources is increasingly putting ecosystems at risk. The world has lost nearly two-thirds of its wildlife populations in the last 50 years. A recent report by the United Nations found that a million species are at risk of extinction – many within decades – because of human activities. The global loss in biodiversity, the report warned, is a threat to human life. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Prince Charles and naturalist David Attenborough — who wrote the report's forward — each made remarks at an event marking its release. Originally commissioned by the British Treasury, the study is meant to guide the United Kingdom's economic policy going forward. In a statement, environmental justice group Global Witness celebrated the report's findings while encouraging the British government to go further: ""To make this a reality, there need to be material consequences for companies and financial institutions which continue to destroy biodiverse ecosystems, including the world's forests. That is why we are calling on governments, including the UK, to ensure that the finance sector is held accountable for their role in bankrolling global deforestation."" The report comes at a pivotal moment for climate policy. Later this year, international leaders are scheduled to convene a conference on biodiversity in Kunming, China. Soon after, the UN Climate Change Conference will take place in Glasgow. In preparation for those meetings, dozens of countries – including some of the world's largest economies – have made pledges to conserve 30 percent of the world's land and water by the year 2030, with the goal of combatting climate change and slowing extinction. President Joe Biden signed an executive action during his first full week in office directing the U.S. to set a similar goal.

17,https://www.npr.org/2021/02/02/963014373/how-fast-will-biden-need-to-move-on-climate-really-really-fast,NPR,Centrist,"In a flurry of first-week executive orders, President Biden sent a definitive message that his administration would move faster on climate change than any before. Now, the question is whether it will be fast enough. Scientists warn that the coming decade will be critical for slowing heat-trapping emissions, potentially keeping average annual global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to the mid-19th century. Right now, the world is on track for an increase of 3 degrees Celsius, a level that ensures more destructive wildfires and hurricanes, devastation for coral reefs and rising seas flooding the coastlines. Biden has set a goal of making the U.S. carbon neutral by 2050, which will require steeper emissions cuts than the U.S. has ever achieved. To reach it, coal power would have to wane into a footnote, replaced by renewables like solar and wind. Most cars would run on batteries, instead of gas. He has also emphasized investing in communities that are hardest hit, both communities of color that bear the highest pollution burden and those that depend on disappearing fossil fuel jobs. ""We need to increase tree cover five times faster than we are,"" said John Kerry, Biden's special envoy for climate. ""We need to ramp up renewable energy six times faster. And the transition to electric vehicles needs to take place at a rate 22 times faster."" Prevailing winds are blowing in Biden's direction. Renewable energy is increasingly cheaper and, along with a glut of natural gas, is driving coal power plants to retire. States and companies are pursuing their own goals to cut emissions. Still, reversing the Trump administration's environmental rollbacks could potentially take years. The administration will also need the cooperation of Congress to dramatically increase investment in climate policies. Biden says even without Congress, climate will be a priority across all federal agencies. ""To me, that suggests that it's not just a campaign promise, but that the administration is really committed to achieving this goal,"" says Angel Hsu, assistant professor at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""That said, it's very easy to make these types of goals and pledges. The hard part really comes in the follow through."" What's working in Biden's favor Early in the Trump administration, officials took aim at one of former President Barack Obama's key climate policies: limits on emissions from the dirtiest power plants, a policy known as the Clean Power Plan. Trump rolled back the plan, but emissions from power plants have still fallen. Despite Trump's support for the coal industry, it's continued to shrink. ""Coal-fired power plants are just uneconomic and are continuing to retire,"" says Dan Lashof, director of the World Resources Institute. ""But much of the power from coal plans has been replaced by natural gas-fired power plants, and we need to start making that transition away from gas. And that means doubling or tripling the pace at which we're building wind and solar over the next decade."" Renewables are increasingly becoming the most affordable option for electric utilities. Biden is seeking to speed up that trend by investing in clean energy projects through economic recovery spending, as a way of supporting both job creation and climate goals. Climate policies have also been alive and well in many states across the country, which have passed their own goals on energy efficiency, cleaner cars and renewable energy. ""That's really encouraging that we've had non-federal action on climate change the last fours, despite there being no action at the national level and even reversal,"" Hsu says. ""Even states that you wouldn't expect like Louisiana, just a couple months ago, set a target to decarbonize."" As carbon dioxide pollution from power plants fell, transportation became the country's largest source of greenhouse gases. The Obama administration instituted fuel economy standards that required automakers to improve their efficiency by 5% every year. The Trump administration replaced that with just 1.5% improvements annually. Prior to Trump arriving in office, California and 13 other states pioneered their own tougher standards on tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks. The states' authority to have their own rules hinges on California's ""waiver,"" special permission granted 40 years ago by the federal government for the state to set separate car pollution standards. Trump sought to revoke California's waiver, which the state challenged as being illegal under the Clean Air Act. While that legal battle was playing out, four automakers took California's side, agreeing to meet tougher standards than the Trump administration's fuel economy rules. Even General Motors, which had supported the Trump administration, just announced it would plan to sell all zero-emission cars by 2035. With electric cars booming in overseas markets, economic forces are pushing automakers to speed up the rollout. Biden will seek to usher it along by installing half a million new charging stations domestically and by making the government's fleet of cars all-electric. What's working against Biden On his first day in office, Biden took direct aim at more than 100 Trump-era environmental policies, ordering federal agencies to review and replace them. Many are critical to cutting emissions in the U.S., like limiting emissions of methane from oil and gas wells, a significant source of the potent heat-trapping gas. Still, that process is likely to take years. Many regulations, like the federal fuel economy rules for cars and trucks, require a lengthy rulemaking process with scientific analysis and public comment. As a result, many of the Trump administration's rules only went into effect in his last year in office. Even after that, Biden's environmental rules are likely to be challenged by lawsuits, potentially reaching the Supreme Court and adding years to the process. Future administrations could also undo those rules, just as the Trump administration did. That has some looking to Congress for meaningful climate action, since laws passed there have better sticking power and spending power. ""Ideally, we would have a federal clean electricity standard that would require a steady reduction in emissions to get us to 100% clean power by 2035,"" says Lashof. ""It's unclear whether the votes will be there in Congress."" A high-profile climate bill would test the Democrats' razor-thin margin in the Senate, where support from party conservatives like Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia would be hard won. Instead, Democrats may look to add climate policies to other bills or pass them through the arcane budget process. ""There's a lot of acrimony that you can see in Congress and where we're sitting right now, it's probably hard to see a big bipartisan bill on climate change,"" says Greg Dotson of the University of Oregon, who also worked on energy policy in the U.S. House of Representatives. ""But I don't think that means you stop trying in Congress. Maybe it's tax policy. Maybe it's investment decisions. Maybe it's budgetary issues."" For now, the Biden administration is focusing on executive actions, like banning new oil and gas leases on federal lands and revoking permits for the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have carried carbon-intensive oil from Canada. ""Certainly we're going to look at congressional action,"" Gina McCarthy, Biden's domestic climate advisor, told NPR. ""But right now, we can use the strength of the federal budget and our procurement opportunities to send the right market signals on the kind of technologies and products that we think we need and we know we have available now that are cost-effective and that, again, grow jobs."" The Biden administration's climate ambitions will become clearer this spring when it releases new U.S. commitments for cutting emissions under the Paris climate agreement. Biden announced the U.S. would rejoin the accord on his first day in office, after the Trump administration pulled out and ceased engaging in the international effort. Biden says the U.S. will come back to the table at a key moment, when countries are making new commitments to cut emissions under the Paris accord. Now, he has to convince them he can deliver.","How Fast Will Biden Need To Move On Climate? Really, Really Fast"

The Earth is about 2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer today than it was in the mid-20th century. Scientists warn that humans must keep global temperatures from rising more than about 3 degrees Fahrenheit in order to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change. NASA and NOAA calculate global temperatures using slightly different analyses methods, partly in order to check each other's work. Because 2020 and 2016 were so close in temperature, the two analyses led to different rankings: NASA ranks 2020 as the hottest year on record by a tiny margin, while NOAA ranks it as the second hottest year by an equally tiny margin. ""The ranks don't tell the whole story,"" says Russell Vose, the chief of climate monitoring at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. ""There's been steady warming over the last half century."" No matter how scientists slice the numbers, the pace of global warming is clear. All ten of the hottest years on record have occurred since 2005. The decade that ended in 2020 was the hottest decade on record. The global temperature has increased by about a tenth of a degree Fahrenheit each decade since 1880, and more than twice that quickly since 1981. North America is heating up slightly faster than the global average. The average annual temperature on the continent has increased by about half a degree Fahrenheit per decade since 1981. ""The steady march up decade after decade is the thing that really matters,"" says Lesley Ott, a climate scientist at NASA. Ott studies global concentrations of greenhouse gases — the higher the concentration, the more heat is trapped. She says 2020 was notable because the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased slightly despite economic disruptions caused by the global pandemic. ""While we saw a slight dip in emissions, we know that, in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide concentrations continued to rise,"" Ott says. ""We think [concentrations] just rose at a slightly lower rate than they would have, had there not been the pandemic."" But Ott says it's not particularly surprising that the pandemic didn't reduce greenhouse gas concentrations more. Although the global economy took a big hit, people still burned a lot of fossil fuels. ""It's not really a great analog to how we would reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the future,"" Ott says. ""We would never want to do something that affected people's lives, that affected their ability to get out of their house, go to work, see their families."" Addressing climate change doesn't require lockdowns, she explains. It requires a transition to cleaner transportation, electricity and manufacturing. The extra heat fueled record-breaking disasters in the U.S. 2020 smashed the previous record for the number of climate-driven disasters, including hurricanes, floods, droughts and wildfires, that caused more than $1 billion in damage. The previous record set in both 2011 and 2017 was 16 such large-scale catastrophes. The new record is 22, including 7 hurricanes, a wildfire and a drought.",Federal Scientists Confirm Virtual Tie For Hottest Year On Record

20,https://www.npr.org/2021/01/28/961777665/general-motors-aims-to-be-carbon-neutral-by-2040,NPR,Centrist,"Automaker General Motors has announced aspirations of achieving carbon neutrality by 2040. On the way to that goal, the company hopes to eliminate tailpipe emissions by 2035. GM said Thursday it will take a science-based approach to become carbon neutral, balancing carbon dioxide emissions and removal efforts. Furthermore, it plans to eliminate gas-powered, light-duty vehicle production by 2035, it said. It intends that by 2025, 40% of its vehicles will be battery powered. ""General Motors is joining governments and companies around the globe working to establish a safer, greener and better world,"" said Mary Barra, GM chairman and CEO. ""We encourage others to follow suit and make a significant impact on our industry and on the economy as a whole."" Transportation is the largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, just over 28%, the Environmental Protection Agency reported. Which is why GM and other industry leaders have joined the Science Based Targets initiative, which calls on businesses to take action to combat climate change. Sam Abuelsamid, principal research analyst at Guidehouse Insights, said initiative participants cannot make empty promises. Their results will be independently verified to hold them accountable. Carbon emissions in vehicles and factories are easily measured. ""They're no longer saying that it's not really a problem,"" he said. ""Companies across the spectrum are making changes because they know that in the long term if they don't make changes, if all of society doesn't make changes, it will have negative effects on their business."" A clear step for GM to become carbon neutral is to transition from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles. Traditional gas vehicles make up about 75% of GM's greenhouse emissions, the company said. Their production facilities make up the other 25%, which the manufacturer aims to eliminate by using wind and solar energy. GM said it will power its U.S. sites with 100% renewable energy by 2030 and globally by 2035. It's a tall order, Abuelsamid admitted, but it's possible. GM said it is working with EVgo vehicle charging stations to add ""more than 2,700 new fast chargers by the end of 2025 ... powered by 100 percent renewable energy."" The bigger obstacle falls on the consumer. An electric vehicle is significantly more expensive. The Natural Resources Defense Council says the average electric car costs $19,000 more than a gasoline-powered car. But GM has spent years improving its battery technology, which may be why it is confident it can eliminate tailpipe emissions in the next 14 years. 'To do that and be successful they will have to make [electric cars] prices competitive,"" Abuelsamid said. ""GM is confidant they can do that, they think they have the technology to do that. But we will have to see.""",General Motors Aims To Be Carbon Neutral By 2040

But the ban is largely symbolic: The U.S. and the world's other nuclear powers have not signed the treaty. ""For the first time in history, nuclear weapons are going to be illegal in international law,"" Elayne Whyte, Costa Rica's former U.N. ambassador who oversaw the treaty's creation, tells NPR's Geoff Brumfiel. The ban prohibits countries from producing, testing, acquiring, possessing or stockpiling nuclear weapons. It also outlaws the transfer of the weapons and forbids signatories from allowing any nuclear explosive device to be stationed, installed or deployed in their territory. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons was adopted in the summer of 2017, in hopes of bringing new momentum to the push to curb the deadliest armament in the world. But even then, it was seen more as a moral statement than an enforceable ban. The treaty is a 96-page reminder to nuclear weapons states, Whyte said, that ""they need to be moving forward"" with disarmament. ""How did the international community deal with slavery, colonialism? Once you delegitimize that conduct, it completely has an impact on the policymaking process,"" she said. The problem with the ban, global security analysts say, is that while dozens of countries say an outright prohibition is the best way to move ahead with disarmament, others — particularly those who possess nuclear weapons — disagree. The new treaty has also been seen as potentially undercutting the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that took effect in 1970. But its backers argue that nonproliferation has stagnated, decades after the U.S. and others agreed to that treaty. ""Supporters of the ban treaty say it serves to delegitimize nuclear weapons and reinforce global norms against use,"" the Nuclear Threat Initiative's Isabelle Williams wrote in 2017. She added later, ""the new treaty is clear evidence of the worrying polarization of states — polarization driven, in part, by a perceived complacency among the nuclear-armed states and unwillingness to take serious steps to reduce the risks posed by nuclear weapons."" The treaty currently has 86 signatories. It has been ratified in 51 of those member states. Early signatories included the Holy See, New Zealand, Thailand and Austria. In the past year, countries such as Belize, Benin and Ireland have ratified or approved the treaty. Nations that signed the treaty cite ""the catastrophic humanitarian consequences that would result from any use of nuclear weapons,"" including by accident or miscalculation, saying those effects would transcend international borders. Detonating a nuclear weapon, the signatories say, would ""pose grave implications for human survival, the environment, socioeconomic development, the global economy, food security and the health of current and future generations, and have a disproportionate impact on women and girls, including as a result of ionizing radiation."" The treaty sets the goal of achieving a nuclear-weapon-free world, saying it would serve ""both national and collective security interests."" Any use of nuclear weapons, it adds, ""would be contrary to the rules of international law"" for armed conflict.","U.N. Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapons Takes Effect, Without The U.S. And Other Powers"

Judith and Doug Saum have moved already, recently leaving their home outside Reno, Nev. ""It was with a view of the Sierra [Nevada Mountains] that was just to die for,"" Judith says. ""We had a lot of friends, musician friends, we'd get together and play music with them often. It wasn't easy to leave all that."" The Saums had long thought about retiring to Colorado or Montana to be near family. But as they started making those plans several years ago, they were also noticing a new problem: Wildfire season was getting worse and longer in their part of the country, fueled by climate change. ""For me, it was unbearable because I was so sensitive to the smoke that I start to swell up,"" says Judith.  ""I get sinus infections, and going outside was intolerable."" The Saums settled on northern New England and a house in the rural town of Rumney at the foot of New Hampshire's White Mountains. Doug Saum says they call themselves climate migrants. ""We had the idea ... not necessarily that we were going to a place that would be forever untouched by climate change, but that we were getting out of a bad climate situation that was only likely to get worse,"" he says. For others, climate-related hazards will be just one reason to move. Bess Samuel says her family has wanted to leave Huntsville, Ala., for a less conservative place for a while — and rising temperatures and power bills could seal the deal. ""I feel like I have to be realistic — this is as good as it's going to get for a while,"" Samuel says. ""We keep hearing these things ... it's the hottest summer and it's the hottest summer and that trend doesn't seem to be reversing."" Jola Ajibade studies climate migration as an assistant professor at Portland State University in Oregon. ""Impermanence might be the new normal for many of us,"" she says. ""The idea that you have to live in one place forever, I think people have to forget that... And I think people who have been able to do that historically, I think it's a privilege that they should celebrate."" But she says all this moving around can make people resilient. And if the places that will receive these new residents can be resilient and flexible, too, the communities might just benefit from it. Pandemic influx shows the need to plan ""When we've talked about climate migration, it usually comes up in the context of the jobs that we just can't fill,"" says Sarah Marchant, the community development director in Nashua, N.H. Nashua has already seen its Puerto Rican population grow after Hurricane Maria hit the island, and it expects more climate migrants from Boston and other nearby coastal areas. ""I think the city is well-positioned with the infrastructure we already have, and our location that is very desirable,"" Marchant says. ""We are an hour from Boston, a little over an hour from the Seacoast and two hours to the mountains, and so we are connected to everything."" By some measures, Nashua's region could be an ideal climate haven.  It's getting warmer, but it doesn't face the existential threats of, say, Florida from hurricanes and flooding or California from wildfires and smoke. Northern New England is also one of the oldest and whitest parts of the country and has struggled with population loss. But it's hard to predict the scale and timing of climate migration. And an influx of newcomers during the current pandemic is showing just how disruptive unplanned growth can be. ""An increase in traffic, people getting evicted, a lack of hospital beds because there's more people – these are the kinds of things that create tension,"" says Anna Marandi, a senior climate specialist with the National League of Cities. ""When the systems aren't set up properly in advance to hold more people, then the existing population can get resentful."" So Sarah Marchant says Nashua is keeping migration and other climate impacts in mind while tackling existing problems with affordable housing and overstretched infrastructure. The idea is ""to ensure that what we are building is sustainable,"" she says, and to ""be smarter about what we do have."" Whether or not the climate migrants come, she says Nashua is making improvements that will benefit everyone. This story includes reporting by New Hampshire Public Radio producer Justine Paradis.

24,https://www.npr.org/2021/01/20/958472682/pandemic-drastically-cut-emissions-from-cars-the-lone-exception-suvs,NPR,Centrist,"Last year, as pandemic lockdowns put travel on hold, wealthy countries reduced their environmentally-harmful emissions in almost every sector of their economies. There was one exception ... one big, road-hogging, gas-guzzling exception. According to a recent report from International Energy Agency, carbon emissions from SUVs increased by 0.5% in 2020, even though the world's energy-related emissions overall fell by 7%. SUVs are less fuel efficient than smaller, lighter and more aerodynamic cars. They're also highly profitable for automakers and highly popular with consumers. The combined force of buyer preference and manufacturer incentives has led to a huge boom in the bigger vehicles — and sales stayed surprisingly strong in 2020. The result? Rising emissions from SUVs. The increase in the number of SUVs on the road was so dramatic that — even though lockdowns caused the number of miles driven per vehicle, on average, to go down — the total consumption of oil by SUVs still went up, the IEA found. This is not a new trend: SUV emissions have been growing for years. But the IEA found it remarkable that the growth managed to defy even the disruptions of the pandemic. And this steadfast increase in emissions has ominous implications for the climate, even as more automakers are promoting electric vehicles. In fact, the IEA says in 2020 the decline in oil use thanks to electric vehicles ""was completely cancelled out by the growth in SUV sales over the same period."" Well before the pandemic, some observers had been sounding the alarm that the boom in bigger vehicles was very bad news for climate efforts.  In 2019, Greenpeace called the car industry ""grotesque"" for promoting ever-bigger vehicles despite their inefficiency. But vehicle shoppers have flocked to SUVs and their smaller cousins, crossovers. And in most cases, it's not because they need to go off-road. ""Americans have a love affair with SUVs,"" says Jessica Caldwell, the executive director of insights at Edmunds. ""They have a more commanding presence on the road than passenger cars and far more versatile, usable cargo areas. For drivers in congested cities, SUV ride height allows passengers a better view of the road which is a great bonus when sitting in traffic. ""But most notably, SUVs evoke the feeling of being able to go anywhere or do anything, and nothing resonates better with the American consumer than the promise of freedom,"" she says. Vehicles overall have been growing more fuel-efficient. But the rise of SUVs undercuts that progress. Automakers have argued that the strong consumer appetite for larger SUVs and crossovers makes it impractical if not impossible to meet ambitious fleet-wide fuel economy standards. Margo Oge, a former EPA official who worked on those fuel efficiency standards, says that to tackle the problem, the Biden administration needs to mandate more ambitious targets for SUVs, specifically, while looking toward a future without gas-powered vehicles at all. ""The Biden administration should set a target for all new light duty vehicle sales [to be] electric by 2035,"" she said. Some countries, as well as states like California, have already set such targets. Sebastian Castellanos, a researcher at the New Urban Mobility Alliance, has studied SUV emissions and agrees that shifting toward electric SUVs is ""a move in the right direction,"" but not sufficient on its own. He argues it's also key for government policies to ""move consumers towards more efficient, climate-friendly modes of transportation such as transit, walking and cycling, and away from use of private cars as the de facto way for people to move around.""",Pandemic Drastically Cut Emissions From Cars.

On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justine Trudeau said completing the project is a key priority for him. On this side of the border, one of the unions that want Biden to allow construction on the pipeline to continue is an Oklahoma local with a history of racism and sexism. Pipeliners Local 798 faces a new class-action lawsuit that claims Black members were denied promotions that were given instead to less-qualified white coworkers. The Pipeliners union is a powerful force in pipeline construction. With more than 8,000 members it works on pipeline construction projects across the country and has been a vocal supporter of the Keystone XL. The union's history is relevant to Biden's position on the pipeline because environmental justice is a centerpiece of the president-elect's plan to address climate change. Biden vowed to protect communities of color that are disproportionately harmed by pollution and ensure people of color are given preferential treatment in developing clean energy jobs. The plaintiff in this newest lawsuit, which was filed in November, is a Georgia man named Rodney Jones. His attorney says he's not commenting on the case as it proceeds through the court system. The complaint, filed in federal court in Tulsa, says Jones worked as a welder helper for the union in 2019 and was subjected to racial slurs and jokes from white coworkers. The complaint says when Jones tried to advance to the journeyman level, he was denied that opportunity while less-qualified white workers were allowed. Another Black member of the union named in the case, J.M. McIntosh, says a white colleague threw a rock at him partially blinding him in the eye. In the complaint, McIntosh says fellow union members refused to take him to the hospital, while a white welder with a similar injury was taken to a doctor immediately several days earlier. ""We're confident in the facts that will be presented. We're passionate about the cause... And we're happy to represent these people and to help them find some justice if we're able,"" says attorney Matt Miller-Novak. The company building the Keystone XL pipeline was quick to respond to allegations made against one of the unions that would get work building the project. ""We have no tolerance for racism in our company. Inclusion and diversity are at the heart of who we are and embedded in our core values,"" TC Energy Spokesperson Terry Cunha tells NPR. Local 798 is part of a national union, the United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters, which signed a labor agreement with the company last year. The local has lobbied for the pipeline as part of its effort to secure more work for its members. Pipeliners Local 798 did not respond to NPR's request to comment on the case. But in 2017 Business Manager Danny Hendrix told NPR his union has a clear policy prohibiting discrimination. At that time, NPR reported that for about 20 years Local 798 was under a strict oversight of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The union was forced to actively recruit and admit women and African-Americans. In the court case leading to that oversight, federal court Judge H. Dale Cook noted in his decision that there were ""no black members and there were no female members until the eve of the trial, May 1986, when Local 798 admitted a woman into the membership."" The EEOC ended its oversight in 2007 but members continued to experience racism that included things like nooses left at work sites where Black workers could find them and racial slurs scrawled on pipelines. Three decades later, when NPR pointed out to Hendrix that his entire leadership team continues to be all white men Hendrix said, ""The cream always comes to the top and I've surrounded myself by some of the best leaders in the pipeline industry. Are they white? They just happen to be, yes."" Environmental groups that have long opposed the Keystone XL pipeline were quick to criticize the Pipeliners union. ""Reports of racial discrimination within the oil industry is unsurprising given the history of violence and racism in how fossil fuel corporations have pushed dirty pipeline projects through Indigenous, Black, low income communities of color, poisoning their water and land for profit,"" said Thanu Yakupitiyage, U.S. Communications Director, at 350.org. On Monday TC Energy announced it would power pumping stations along the Keystone XL with renewable electricity by 2030. It was an apparent bid to save the project as it was widely reported in Canada that Biden was preparing to withdraw a presidential permit needed to continue construction. Emissions from operating the pipeline are not what's controversial. Instead it's the oil sands crude the pipeline would carry from Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast. What critics call ""tar sands"" oil emits more of the greenhouse gasses that contribute to climate change because it needs more processing to make it usable. The 1,700-mile, $8 billion pipeline that would carry oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast was first proposed in 2008 and rejected by the Obama administration, and then revived under President Trump.

26,https://www.npr.org/2021/01/19/956005206/supreme-court-considers-baltimore-suit-against-oil-companies,NPR,Centrist,"Updated at 2:30 p.m. ET The Supreme Court heard arguments on Tuesday in a case brought by the city of Baltimore against more than a dozen major oil and gas companies including BP, ExxonMobil and Shell. The city government argued that the fossil fuel giants must pay for the costs of climate change because they knew that their products cause potentially catastrophic global warming. The Baltimore case is one of more than 20 similar suits brought by cities, states and counties in recent years. The cases make a variety of arguments about why fossil fuel companies bear responsibility for the costs of climate change, including that companies misled the public about the threat burning oil and gas poses to the climate. The Supreme Court is considering a narrow jurisdictional question: the Baltimore case was filed in state court, but during the 75-minute opening arguments on Tuesday, an attorney for the fossil fuel companies contended that such cases should be tried in federal court. ""These cases have the potential to be quite powerful if they finally see their day in court,"" says Karen Sokol, a law professor at Loyola University of New Orleans who has written extensively about climate liability cases. Sokol says state courts have a long history of handling cases about consumer protection, including lawsuits involving alleged corporate misinformation campaigns. If the Supreme Court decides in Baltimore's favor, it would likely pave the way for cases against oil and gas companies to proceed in state courts across the country. But in court filings the fossil fuel industry argues that federal courts are the most appropriate legal venue for such cases. ""The issues here are inherently federal,"" says Phil Goldberg, an attorney with the firm Shook, Hardy and Bacon in Washington, D.C., who represents the National Association of Manufacturers. The association filed a brief in support of oil and gas companies in the Baltimore case. ""This isn't something the energy companies created. This is a byproduct of modern society,"" Goldberg says. ""All the companies are doing is engaging in a lawful business endeavor. And what that is is selling us the energy we need to drive our cars, turn on our lights, heat and cool our homes. And doing that is not a liability-causing event."" Sokol says she believes the fossil fuel industry is trying to avoid state court cases that could expose how companies misled the public about the dangers of burning oil and gas. ""They're basically fighting to keep this out [of] state court because they're desperate to keep the social license that they've cultivated with this disinformation campaign,"" she says of the fossil fuel industry. ""It has never been held to account in this way in this country. It has wielded such economic and political might, it's never had to face a threat quite like this."" A city underwater The lawsuits brought by states, cities and counties describe the widespread damage climate change is already causing across the country. Baltimore's 2018 lawsuit paints a picture of a city overwhelmed by global warming. Court filings describe the ""cascading social and economic impacts"" of climate change in Baltimore, including dramatic increases in flood damage from both rain and sea level rise, increasingly deadly heat waves and massive infrastructure failures exacerbated by extreme weather. As in many cities, some neighborhoods in Baltimore are heat islands where the temperature is significantly warmer than the surrounding area. In other parts of the city, climate-driven extreme rain routinely turns roads into rivers. Meanwhile, the port city's century-old sewer and stormwater systems are unable to handle both sea level rise and more rain. ""Our stormwater systems are not adequate because they didn't take into account climate-change impacts,"" says Lisa McNeilly, the director of Baltimore's Office of Sustainability. The city's sewer and stormwater pipes were laid in the early 20th century and, at the time, were state-of-the-art. But the pipes were not designed to handle sea level rise and extreme rain caused by climate change. When a lot of rain falls in a short period of time, raw sewage can flow into city waterways or back up into homes. McNeilly says the city government is working as quickly as it can to adapt to more water, but the scale of the work is enormous and the effects of climate change are already abundantly clear. One example, McNeilly says, is a thunderstorm that hit the city in the summer of 2019. ""In one hour, somewhere between 5 and 7 inches fell over a small portion of downtown and some communities east of downtown,"" she says. ""We very quickly had 7 feet of water in these downtown areas."" The thunderstorm happened to hit the city at the same time as a high tide. Sea level rise means higher tides, which means more encroachment of water from the harbor into stormwater pipes that are already overwhelmed by extreme rain. Sea levels are rising more quickly than the global average along much of the U.S. East Coast. The Baltimore city government estimates that the portion of downtown that regularly floods will increase by nearly 150% in the next 30 years. ""It's just mind-numbing,"" says Bruna Attila, the floodplain manager for the city's Office of Sustainability. ""It's overwhelming to think about that."" While city officials declined to comment on the details of the case pending in the Supreme Court, it is clear that the cost of adapting to the new climate far exceeds what the city can afford. Baltimore is not a rich city, and finding money to upgrade aging infrastructure is already a struggle. Global warming is imposing additional costs by accelerating the damage. In recent years, sinkholes have opened under multiple city streets — likely due to a combination of failing pipes and large amounts of precipitation. In 2014, a line of parked cars crashed onto train tracks in the middle of the city after a retaining wall failed. Repairing such damage could cost tens of millions of dollars, on top of the hundreds of millions of dollars required to routinely upgrade drainage and sewer pipes. Meanwhile, the city's court filings point out that each summer brings longer and more severe heat waves which increase the risk of heat stroke and asthma-related hospital visits, and which require the city to upgrade housing, provide cooling centers and redevelop neighborhoods that have turned into dangerous heat islands. ""These companies must be held accountable. Climate change is a reality,"" said Andre Davis, the then-solicitor of Baltimore, at a press conference announcing the lawsuit in 2018. ""The companies knew of the harm decades ago. If it had been disclosed, the problem of climate change could have been mitigated significantly. That's our claim."" The future of climate liability cases Virtually none of Baltimore's specific claims about the effects of climate change, or the responsibility of fossil fuel companies, came up on Tuesday when the case was presented before the Supreme Court. The court is only considering the narrow question of whether the case should be allowed to proceed in state court. The companies, which include some of the largest oil and gas companies in the world, are fighting to keep the case in federal court. They argue that reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to global warming are nationwide challenges that should be handled at the national level, ideally outside the courts. ""This has to be done in a thoughtful, centralized way where we focus on innovation and collaboration and not this litigation distraction,"" says Goldberg, the attorney representing the National Association of Manufacturers. In their legal arguments, the fossil fuel companies appear to be leaning heavily on the decision in a previous case decided by the Supreme Court in 2011. That case, brought by the state of Connecticut against an electricity company, alleged that the company was liable for releasing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. The Supreme Court's unanimous decision was that the company couldn't be sued for its emissions under federal law. ""It was part of the first wave of climate cases that were pursuing liability [claims] against various parts of the industry — whether it's energy manufacturers, utilities, those who bring us the energy that we all use and need every day — and make them liable for climate change,"" says Goldberg. Those cases, brought in federal court, were unsuccessful. ""We're hopeful that the court will look at this the exact same way it did the previous cases."" But Karen Sokol of Loyola University New Orleans, who has spent much of her career studying climate liability cases, says the new wave of climate liability cases is different. In the last decade, investigative reporting has revealed the extent to which companies knew about the connection between climate change and burning fossil fuels. Climate science has also matured. It's now possible to detect the effects of global warming in individual weather events, including extreme rain storms, hurricanes, droughts, heat waves and wildfires. The connection between burning fossil fuels and specific damage from extreme weather has never been more verifiable. Lastly, Sokol says, the new wave of lawsuits have a completely new set of allegations. The first wave of cases, which included the Connecticut case, alleged that companies were liable for greenhouse emissions. The new wave of lawsuits allege deceptive marketing practices by oil and gas companies that billed their products as safe. ""That's a very, very different claim,"" Sokol says. The Supreme Court will announce its decision later this year on the narrow question of whether the Baltimore case should be considered in state or federal court. If the justices decide in favor of the companies and the case proceeds in federal court, it's possible that the lawsuit will be eventually dismissed without a trial. However, if the justices decide in favor of Baltimore, it is likely that the case will proceed in Maryland state court, which could require the companies in the case to turn over vast troves of documents about their businesses and marketing practices over the decades.",Supreme Court Considers Baltimore Suit Against Oil Companies Over Climate Change

U.S. greenhouse gas emissions fell by 10 percent, the largest annual drop since World War II, according to a report by the Rhodium Group. Still, the climate diet isn't likely to stick. The reductions were largely due to temporary changes during lockdown orders. By the end of the year, Americans were already back to driving and flying more. To make the deep cuts that climate scientists say are needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the U.S. will need to make more lasting changes, like switching the nation's electric grid to solar, wind and other low-carbon energy sources. ""The emission reductions of 2020 have come with an enormous toll of significant economic damage and human suffering,"" says the report by the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm. ""Without meaningful structural changes in the carbon intensity of the US economy, emissions will likely rise again as well."" The dip in 2020 also isn't likely to dramatically slow the rate of climate change. While emissions over the last year were less than expected, the U.S. continued polluting, so the overall amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere went up. Essentially, it's like a bathtub being filled with water. The U.S. turned down the faucet, but it was still filling the tub. Transportation, the largest source of U.S. emissions, fell by almost 15 percent in 2020 compared to the previous year. Demand for jet fuel fell almost 70 percent in April and has only rebounded by about half since, according to the report. Diesel fuel, which powers the trucking industry, stayed fairly constant as goods and deliveries continued to flow. Still, not all of the reductions are fleeting. While the demand for electricity was close to normal in 2020, emissions from power plants fell by 10 percent, due in large part to the continued decline of coal. Once the dominant source of electricity in the country, coal-fired power plants have been shuttering in recent years, driven out of business by the low cost of natural gas and renewable energy. The emissions drop in 2020 is also a sobering reminder of how far the U.S. has to go to achieve international climate targets. Even with the pandemic-driven drop, the country still didn't reach the emissions cuts it had pledged under the Paris Agreement, which aimed for greenhouse gas pollution at 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels. The Biden Administration has vowed to make climate a priority, including rejoining the international agreement. But with the Trump Administration's reversal of many Obama-era climate policies, Biden will have to take on even more ambitious policies.",Pandemic Causes Historic — But Fleeting— Drop In U.S. Climate Emissions
30,https://www.npr.org/2021/01/13/956592508/new-charges-in-flint-water-crisis-including-former-michigan-gov-rick-snyder,NPR,Centrist,"Updated at 9:28 p.m. ET Former Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder was charged Wednesday for his role in the Flint water crisis, an environmental disaster that contaminated the majority Black city's drinking water with lead nearly seven years ago. Snyder is facing two counts of willful neglect of duty and if convicted he could face up to a year in prison and as much as a $1,000 fine. Other former members of his administration are expected to face charges as well, according to the Associated Press. Earlier this week, as reports began to surface that charges were looming, an attorney for Snyder referred to them as ""a politically motivated smear campaign,"" according to the Detroit Free Press. Snyder, a Republican, was Michigan's top executive when state-appointed officials decided to switch the city's drinking water source from Detroit's water system to the Flint River in 2014. It stems from a decision billed as a way to save money and only supposed to be a temporary fix while officials built a pipeline to nearby Lake Huron. But it turned out to be costly, both in lives lost and in a settlement worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Pending settlement for victims Last year Nessel announced a $600 million-dollar settlement for Flint families impacted by the water crisis last year. The deal ""puts the needs of children first,"" she said during the August announcement. Young people were especially vulnerable, at risk of suffering long-term cognitive challenges and other health issues from being exposed to lead contamination in the water. As NPR's Bill Chappell reported at the time the settlement indicated that nearly 80% of the funds were earmarked to resolved claims filed on behalf of children and minors. The remaining portion of the settlement is expected to be divvied up among other Flint residents who fell ill from the contaminated water or suffered property damage, Michigan Public Radio reports. But a U.S. District Court judge is expected to soon rule on whether to give the settlement preliminary approval, MPR reports. At least 12 died, more than 80 became sick The station adds not everyone is happy with the settlement. That includes John McClain, a pastor, who characterized the proposed settlement as ""disrespectful,"" because he said there are too many roadblocks for residents to access the money and it doesn't provide enough to cover damages. ""We believe the proposed settlement as currently allocated is just as disrespectful as the injury caused by the water crisis tragedy itself,"" McClain told MPR. At least dozen people died and more than 80 people were sickened with Legionnaires' disease after water from the Flint River caused lead to leach from old pipes, poisoning the water system city. Soon after the switch, residents began to complain that the new water in their homes had a foul stench, tasted different and was discolored, according to an MLive report from May 2014, a month after the change in water sources. Officials with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality told Flint city officials they did not need to use any corrosion control measures to treat the river water, at least not initially, Michigan Public Radio reported in December 2016. The ""wait-and-see approach was a really bad idea,"" experts told MPR, because without the necessary treatment ""the protective coating on the inside of the pipes that built up over the years from Detroit's water likely disappeared. And that's what caused lead levels to spike in many homes in Flint."" Snyder, who has been out of office for two years, apologized for his role in the environmental debacle during his 2016 State of the State address. ""Your families face a crisis, a crisis which you did not create and could not have prevented,"" Snyder said. ""I want to speak directly, honestly and sincerely to let you know we are praying for you. We are working hard for you and we are absolutely committed to taking the right steps to effectively solve this crisis. To you, the people of Flint, I say ... I'm sorry and I will fix it."" More than a dozen state and city officials were indicted for their roles in the crisis. Several of them accepted plea deals to avoid prison time. In June of 2019 Nessel announced that state prosecutors were dropping all criminal charges against a group of eight government officials, and moved to launch a more expansive investigation. ""I want to remind the people of Flint that justice delayed is not always justice denied and a fearless and dedicated team of career prosecutors and investigators are hard at work to ensure those who harmed you are held accountable,"" Nessel said in a statement at the time.

31,https://www.npr.org/2021/01/13/956192132/progressives-gear-up-for-broad-new-push-on-climate-action,NPR,Centrist,"A coalition of progressive groups say they are organizing a sweeping network to mobilize around climate change, racial and environmental justice, making a new unified push as President-elect Joe Biden is days away from taking office with Democrats set to control both the House and the Senate. The group, the Green New Deal Network, plans to invest in partner organizations in 20 key states to mobilize grassroots power to pressure elected officials to support their goals; introduce Green New Deal-related legislation at the state and local level, spearhead federal legislation that would implement parts of the Green New Deal agenda, and to pressure the incoming Biden administration to enact a series of executive actions related to climate, jobs and justice. ""Every day [SEIU members] confront the crisis of climate, as well as environmental racism and economic inequality, so the Green New Deal is not something that is abstract to them,"" said Rocio Sáenz, the executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union. ""For our members the Green New Deal means clear air, clean water, safe communities, good jobs and a growing economy. So this, for us, is why we are part of this network. What we see, especially now more than ever, is that we cannot think about these issues in siloes."" Named for the sweeping proposal for cutting U.S. contributions to climate change over the next decade, the coalition has already raised more than $20 million, organizers say. Introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, the Green New Deal sparked a fierce political debate on how to best combat climate change.  The plan drew significant attention from President Trump and Republican lawmakers, who have panned the plan as costly and unrealistic and used the policy to cast Democratic supporters of the framework as socialists. The Green New Deal was introduced as a nonbinding resolution, written with out some specifics, making it challenging to specify a price tag. Supporters say the plan will pay for itself through economic growth, and that the urgency of the climate crisis requires a bold and immediate response. The groups coming together to back it now include the Center for Popular Democracy, Climate Justice Alliance, Grassroots Global Justice, Greenpeace, Indigenous Environmental Network, Indivisible, the Movement for Black Lives, MoveOn, People's Action, Right to the City, Service Employees International Union, the Sierra Club, Sunrise Movement, US Climate Action Network and the Working Families Party. Leaders of the coalition say they plan to put the majority of their resources into a coordinated campaign stitched-together across key states, that rely on local activists and organizers. ""We have a shot to create millions of green jobs, to transform the way our economy works so it actually helps working people,"" said Kaniela Ing, the climate justice campaign director for People's Action. ""Change doesn't happen from the top down. You can't just hire a bunch of experts and lobbyists if you want something to be lasting. We're not just lobbying D.C., we're actually lobbying on the ground in all 50 states."" They are also applying pressure at the federal level. The Green New Deal Network has already written a letter to President-elect Biden and his transition team, arguing that ""there is a dire need for action beyond legislation."" ""Massive federal investment is past due and a down payment on a regenerative future is urgently needed,"" the coalition wrote, calling on the incoming Biden administration to do ""everything within its authority to ensure healthy communities, a more just economy and a livable planet."" The letter calls for a number of steps that the coalition argues that Biden could take unilaterally, including an executive order upgrading public buildings, transportation and energy in a transition to a clean energy economy; an executive order that requires federal agencies to secure informed tribal consent from Indigenous nations; declaring a national climate emergency; and banning new fossil fuel projects on federal and tribal lands and waters, as well as in environmental justice communities. For his part, Biden has announced his own climate change agenda that stops short of endorsing the Green New Deal. It includes trillions of dollars in spending on green initiatives and calls for the elimination of greenhouse gas pollution by 2050. Late last year, he named key members of his climate change team, including former Obama-era EPA director Gina McCarthy to lead a new White House Office of Climate policy and New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland to lead the Department of the Interior. Haaland is a congressional co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. ""We're going to call on President-elect Biden to lean into the agenda that he ran on, which was bold with a vision for addressing climate change and racial and economic justice,"" said Saenz. ""We know that our job will continue to be to hold him accountable to his promises, to support him and support other elected officials when they do right, and to campaign hard against those that would stand in the way."" Some compared the scope of the effort to that of the Health Care for America Now coalition, the vast, progressive coalition that was crucial to the Affordable Care Act cause. ""That work was critical to convincing the Obama administration that there was a real path to get the legislation through,"" said Maurice Mitchell, the national director of of the Working Families Party. ""So we plan on using that strategy. Sometimes, the best way to influence a president is indirectly by doing the work on the ground and shoring up members of Congress to inspire in the administration the belief that there actually is a legislative path.""Part of that work, said Ing, is helping to build capacity on the ground in a state-by-state level. ""People in their communities know their communities best,"" Ing said. ""We are all the expert of our own experiences, just kind of recognizing that and supporting that by not just bringing money into a state, but creating a way where people can come together cooperatively, build their own local coalitions and then we can support that."" Lindsay Harper, the national coordinator for Arm in Arm, a group organizing to end the climate crisis through fighting for racial and economic justice, said that she views this as an opportunity ""to focus on local fights that have real, true national and international implications."" ""I'm really excited about bringing people's faces and experiences into a conversation where folks from the south, Black folks, Black women, people of color and in some low wealth communities have not been at the table."" Harper said. ""They have not been a part of the fabric. They have not been in an opportunity to lead and to contribute. I think that Georgia spoke very loudly in the last election, so it's very clear that we are an integral point of moving what needs to be moved forward."" The coalition is also taking lessons from past attempts at climate actions including the comprehensive climate package, known as Waxman-Markey, that attempted to create a cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions. The bill, colloquially named for then-Rep. Henry Waxman of California and Sen. Ed Markey, then a representative, passed the House in 2009 and died in the Senate. Leaders of the effort say that one of the reasons that effort collapsed was that it was too much of an ""insider play"" and did not engage organizers and workers in the field, mistakes that organizers say they won't repeat. ""When the far-right movement built a ground swell and pushed back on things like Waxman-Markey, there was no countervailing movement force to challenge that,"" said Mitchell. ""We plan on having a 50-state strategy that is rooted outside, in order to shore up Congress because we know that every single member is going to need to be held accountable."" The new group's leaders also say they will not shy away from backing primary challenges to sitting lawmakers. ""To me and to us, this is a moral imperative,"" said Mitchell. ""We don't have another shot at this. So if the science, if the wildfires in California, if the increased intensity of tropical storms and hurricanes... if all of this isn't enough for you, you don't deserve to be in office.""",Progressives Gear Up For Broad New Push On Climate Action

The move follows announcements by the biggest U.S. banks that there are some industries and activities they don't want to finance, such as drilling for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or making loans to gun manufacturers who make assault-style weapons. Some major banks have sworn off making those loans.  Now, a Trump-appointed banking regulator is pushing for a rule that considers that an unfair, discriminatory practice. ""It's a very poorly constructed rule,"" says John Court, the head of regulatory affairs at the Bank Policy Institute, which represents the biggest banks in the country. He says the rule is ""clearly hastily conceived and hastily constructed."" The rule was proposed in November after President Trump lost his reelection bid. And Court says it appears that the Trump-appointed acting head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is scrambling to enact it before the Biden administration begins next week. Court says many financial firms are getting more focused on environmental, social, and governance — or ""ESG"" — issues. ""Among those are racial equality, climate, other issues,"" Court says. ""And this proposal clearly would undercut the ability of a banking organization to achieve or administer any so-called ESG goals that it might have."" The rule is based on the concept of fair access to credit, which traditionally had to do with preventing racial discrimination. The OCC declined an interview. Acting head Brian Brooks said in a press release that ""fair access to financial services, credit, and capital are essential to our economy."" But critics say the rule is really about forcing banks to finance firearms companies that make assault-style rifles, or even predatory payday lenders that charge 300% in annual interest. ""Payday lenders not only disproportionately harm people of color, they target communities of color,"" says Rebecca Borné, a lawyer with the nonprofit Center for Responsible Lending. ""So the agency is really taking the language of civil rights to do something that's fundamentally inconsistent with the original intent of that language."" says Borné. The result, she adds, would be to exacerbate lending discrimination, ""cloaking it in this language of civil rights."" The main trade group for payday lenders, INFiN, said in a statement that it ""supports steps by the OCC to protect legal businesses from discrimination under the proposed fair access rule."" If the Trump administration finalizes the rule before President-elect Joe Biden takes office, Court says that would make it harder, but not impossible, for the new administration to undo it. And he says if it comes to it, banks would likely sue to try to stop the rule. ""It's removing the ability to make decisions, it's removing that from the bank and effectively vesting it in a government mandate,"" he says. And Court says the rule is so broadly written that it would apply to mundane business decisions as well as broader ones based on what the management of the bank thinks is good or bad for society — whether that involves climate change, assault rifles, payday lending, or anything else. The rule could also be scrapped by Congress through an oversight tool called the Congressional Review Act, especially since Democrats will now control both the House and the Senate.",Trump Regulator's Rule Would Force Banks To Lend To Gun-Makers And Oil Drillers
33,https://www.npr.org/2021/01/06/953718234/major-oil-companies-take-a-pass-on-controversial-lease-sale-in-arctic-refuge,NPR,Centrist,"Updated at 7:54 pm ET One of the Trump administration's biggest environmental rollbacks suffered a stunning setback Wednesday, as a decades-long push to drill for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ended with a lease sale that attracted just three bidders — one of which was the state of Alaska itself. Alaska's state-owned economic development corporation was the only bidder on nine of the parcels offered for lease in the northernmost swath of the refuge, known as the coastal plain. Two small companies also each picked up a single parcel. Half of the offered leases drew no bids at all. ""They held the lease in ANWR — that is history-making. That will be recorded in the history books and people will talk about it,"" said Larry Persily, a longtime observer of the oil and gas industry in Alaska . ""But no one showed up."" The sale generated a tiny fraction of the revenue it was projected to raise. It was a striking moment in a 40-year fight over drilling in the coastal plain, an area that's home to migrating caribou, polar bears, birds and other wildlife. It also potentially sits atop billions of barrels of oil, according to federal estimates. But amid a global recession, low oil prices and an aggressive pressure campaign against leasing by drilling opponents, oil analysts have for months been predicting little interest in the sale. Persily took the sale as evidence that while drilling in the refuge remains a long-held dream of some politicians, it is no longer treasured by oil companies. ""It was, in the oil industry terms, a dry hole. A bust,"" he said. ""They had the lease sale, the administration can feel good about it, but no one's going to see any oil coming out of ANWR."" Even Kara Moriarty, head of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, acknowledged that the sale results weren't as ""robust"" as expected. But she said the industry still supports future access to the coastal plain. ""Today's sale reflects the brutal economic realities the oil and gas industry continues to face after the unprecedented events of 2020, coupled with ongoing regulatory uncertainty,"" she said in a statement. The lease sale raised a total of $14.4 million in bids, according to the Bureau of Land Management, the federal agency that held the sale. Nearly all of that came from Alaska's state-owned economic development corporation, the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority. Half of the cash will go to the federal government, and half will go back to the state of Alaska. The amount raised is nowhere near what was projected when a Republican-led Congress officially opened the coastal plain to drilling in 2017 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The bill ordered two lease sales, the first by the end of this year, with the revenue aimed at offsetting massive tax cuts. Despite the lack of industry interest, Alaska's Congressional delegation applauded the sale on Wednesday, and so did officials with the Bureau of Land Management, describing it as historic and a success. ""It was a joke"" Opponents had a different reaction. ""I laughed out loud. It was a joke. A joke to the American people,"" said Desirée Sorenson-Groves, director of the Arctic Refuge Defense Campaign. ""I'll tell you, I have a message to those who bid today, there were only three. But here's the message: 'You will never ever drill in the Arctic Refuge. We'll stop you.'"" The land that received no bids on Wednesday will not be leased in this sale. Of the two small companies that did win leases, one is Regenerate Alaska, a subsidiary of Australia-based 88 Energy. The other is Knik Arm Services, a small Alaska company managed by an investor named Mark Graber. The state-owned entity which dominated the sale, has never held federal oil leases before. But Alaska politicians, including former Republican Gov. Frank Murkowski, recently pushed the state to bid, citing the lack of industry interest. Murkowski, in an interview Wednesday, said he expects the corporation to eventually partner with companies to do the actual drilling. ""We'll see how good an investment it is when we see what the interest is from some companies to negotiate,"" he said. The oil leases are still not finalized. That process, which includes an anti-trust review by the U.S. Department of Justice, typically takes about two months. But the Trump administration is expected to rush to issue the leases formally before the president leaves office in two weeks. Even if it succeeds, additional oil leasing and drilling in the refuge will face headwinds, said U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., a longtime drilling opponent. He said his next step will be pushing for ""permanent protection"" for the Arctic refuge. He's likely to have support from a Biden administration. The president-elect and his appointee to lead the Interior Department have both said they oppose drilling there, and Georgia's run-off elections give Democrats control of the Senate along with the House. Huffman said he's open to a compromise with drilling boosters — from the state of Alaska to Indigenous Iñupiaq leaders in Kaktovik, the only community inside the refuge's boundaries —  that would provide them with alternative paths toward economic development. ""We're not hostile to taking care of the interests here, and helping put folks on a path of economic development that makes sense and that's sustainable,"" Huffman said. Roger Herrera, a retired BP executive and longtime lobbyist for an Alaska group that pushed Congress to open the refuge, said he was ""hugely disappointed"" in the results of the sale. ""Alaska is a natural resource state,"" he said in a phone interview. ""You take away its natural resources and it has basically nothing.""",Major Oil Companies Take A Pass On Controversial Lease Sale In Arctic Refuge

Wilkerson, who was part of Seattle Public Utilities' Spill Response Team, says the calls were usually from the public. Typically, he says, the caller would tell him, ""Hey, there's a puddle of poo"" in the street. And many times, the excrement would be coming from a recreational vehicle. Starting around 2010, there has been a significant increase in spills coming from RVs and other vehicles in Seattle. It was happening as the number of people living out of their vehicles was on the rise. By one count, 891 people lived out of their vehicles in Seattle and the surrounding area in 2010. Now that number is close to 3,000. ""We saw more people decline into homelessness quicker,"" says Bill Kirlin-Hackett, who directs the Scofflaw Mitigation Team, a city-funded program that helps people living in RVs avoid losing their vehicles for violating city ordinances. ""And if you own a vehicle, the quick response is to live in it, so a lot of people new to homelessness were entering vehicles."" Wilkerson's team realized that many of the waste spills were unintentional. Many of the RVs were dilapidated and not fit for habitation, and there was no public dump site in the city of Seattle. Wilkerson says his team initially proposed the construction of a new dump station geared toward RV dwellers. But in January, Seattle Public Utilities piloted what Wilkerson says has turned out to be a more effective response: a mobile service that goes directly to the source of the problem. Wilkerson is now coordinator of the RV Wastewater Pilot Program. He visits people living in RVs, trucks and automobiles, across the city and offers to pump out their waste for free. A group of volunteers from a local charity goes ahead with food and medical supplies and ask the RV occupants if they need their tanks emptied. Volunteer Mary Jo Shannon is board president of the charity, St. Vincent de Paul. ""These people are wonderful,"" says Shannon of the people living in vehicles. ""And they're human beings that deserve the respect and dignity that all of us do."" RV dweller John Hendrix has been using Wilkerson's service for about four months. When Wilkerson visited him last, he asked whether Hendrix had dumped his waste anywhere since the previous monthly pumping. ""Nope,"" Hendrix answered. ""You know you're my favorite people. You know I can't leave you guys hanging."" Hendrix concedes though that the monthly visits aren't enough. After about three weeks, he says, he uses the bathroom in a nearby medical clinic or sometimes goes in the park. Last year, before the waste removal program was created, there were more than a 100 illegal spills from RVs, according to Wilkerson. He says that number has fallen by 75 percent so far this year. And the people in the RVs are grateful. ""It helps out immensely, that's for sure,"" said Sean Eagle, who recently began living out of one. ""Or else, I wouldn't know what to do.""",Homeless In Seattle Get Help From City Waste Pumper

The event, January 6, marks a major moment in a 40-year fight over whether to develop the northernmost slice of the refuge's coastal plain, home to migrating caribou, birds and polar bears. Biden, as well as his pick for Interior Secretary — Rep. Deb Haaland — oppose drilling in the refuge. The hand-off of drilling rights to the highest bidders could make it more difficult to reverse course. But despite the high stakes, uncertainty looms over how much oil is actually trapped under the million acres of tundra up for leasing, and how much industry interest there is to go find it. 'We don't know very much about this area' The data on what's under the coastal plain is decades old. ""We don't know very much about this area,"" says David Houseknecht, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. Oil seeps and rock formations seem promising, but he says the agency hasn't estimated the coastal plain's oil potential since the late 1990s. Back then, it relied on seismic testing from a decade prior, technology that's now outdated.  It found that anywhere from about 4 to 12 billion barrels of recoverable oil could lie beneath the federal lands. That's a whole lot of oil, but also ""a very large range of uncertainty,"" Houseknecht says. ""The seismic data that we have are quite old, low resolution and a sparse grid."" The other challenge, he says: There's no data from actual wells in the refuge. Just one exploratory well has been drilled in the coastal plain, on Alaska Native land in the 1980s, and the results are a closely-guarded secret. Mark Myers, a former commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, is among only a few people who have seen the well results outside of the oil companies that paid for it. ""I signed a confidentiality agreement, and it didn't have an end date on it,"" he says with a small laugh. ""I can't comment on it, in terms of what I saw."" A New York Times investigation based on interviews and legal documents suggested the results were not promising. Houseknecht says geologists don't know more about the coastal plain's oil potential because it wasn't until late 2017 that Congress decided to allow drilling there, after decades of debate. In recent years, he says, USGS had the 1980s seismic data commercially reanalyzed and planned to use it for a new oil assessment. But after the opening of the refuge three years ago the Interior Department called off the work without providing a reason why. Bidding could be ""fairly lukewarm"" As for who will bid in the lease sale, that's another mystery. Oil and gas companies aren't talking about their plans publicly, which isn't surprising, says Kara Moriarty, head of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, an industry trade group. ""Participation in lease sales is one of the most competitive and secretive things between companies,"" she says. Bidding has already taken place, but Moriarty says she doesn't expect to know more until the federal government unseals companies' bids during the January 6 event, which will be streamed online. Oil industry analyst Rowena Gunn, with the research firm Wood Mackenzie, believes enthusiasm could be ""fairly lukewarm."" Controversy is one reason. ""It wouldn't necessarily be good PR for them to be seen as drilling in the Arctic, or drilling in environmentally-sensitive areas,"" she says. Environmental organizations and some tribal groups have been lobbying oil companies, banks and other financial institutions to stay away from developing the refuge. A number of major banks say they won't fund oil projects in the Arctic. Opponents have also filed multiple lawsuits seeking to block drilling.  They've raised concerns about its impacts on Indigenous people, the global climate, and wildlife, including the caribou that give birth in the coastal plain and the polar bears that den there. Even if leases are sold, legal experts say it's possible that  courts could later cancel them. In response to concerns about wildlife, as well as oil industry interest, the Bureau of Land Management recently removed nearly a third of the original 1.6 million acres from the sale. Geologist Houseknect says those areas do not have high potential for oil. 'Very little capital for exploration' Supporters of drilling the refuge, including many Alaska politicians, argue that it's good for the economy and jobs. Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski worked with the White House to open the coastal plain to drilling as part of Trump's massive 2017 tax bill.  The idea was to create revenue to offset tax cuts, so the legislation directed the federal government to carry out two oil and gas lease sales by 2024. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the leasing program could generate a windfall of $1.8 billion over a decade, to be split between Alaska and the federal government. Critics of the sale, including the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, say they expect the dollar-figure to be much lower. ""For right now, this absolutely seems to make no fiscal sense,"" says Autumn Hanna, vice president of the group. ""We don't need the oil. Why would we be going into such hard-to-access, sensitive places where the costs of exploration and development are so high?"" Myers, the former Alaska commissioner, agrees development costs could dampen interest. It's already more expensive to drill in the Arctic compared to, say, Texas. On top of that, he says, oil prices are still relatively low after an oil-price war and the coronavirus pandemic hit the industry hard. ""The prices have fallen down to a level that leaves very little capital for exploration in these companies,"" Myers says. ""So that's one of the biggest negatives."" But perhaps the greatest uncertainty is the changing administration. President-elect Biden says he opposes drilling in the refuge, and that he'll take steps to permanently protect it, though he hasn't said how. It's possible his administration could delay the environmental permitting process for companies that buy leases from the Trump administration. Or a Biden administration could try to buy the leases back. Citing concerns about limited industry interest, Alaska politicians have lobbied for the state to step in. The board of a state-owned economic development corporation recently voted to bid up to $20 million at the lease sale. The idea is the corporation could operate as a backstop, to submit minimum bids on the tracts and secure drilling rights in case no one else makes any offers. Then, at some point, it could partner with oil companies to do the actual drilling. If any leases are bought and finalized, it will be just the start of a long process. Industry analysts say it would take at least a decade to actually pump oil out of Alaska's Arctic refuge.","After Decades-Long Push, It's Not Clear Who Will Bid In Arctic Refuge Oil Lease Sale"
36,https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-environment-iowa-lawsuits-biofuels-9b148042fbacd2b6f8e7af0178e27acc,AP,Centrist,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — The federal government announced Monday that it will support the ethanol industry in a lawsuit over biofuel waivers granted to oil refineries under President Donald Trump’s administration.  The Environmental Protection Agency said it is reversing course and will support a January 2020 decision by the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a lawsuit filed by the Renewable Fuels Association and farm groups. The lawsuit is headed to arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court this spring.  Federal law requires refiners to blend billions of gallons of biofuels in the nation’s gasoline supply or buy credits from refineries that do the blending. Refineries can seek waivers if they can show that meeting the ethanol quotas would create a financial hardship for their companies.  The appeals court concluded the EPA improperly granted exemptions to refineries that didn’t qualify. The court said that refineries should be granted waivers only as extensions, but most refineries seeking exemptions had not continuously received them year after year. The decision effectively limited the EPA’s ability to grant most exemptions. Two refineries appealed the decision to the Supreme Court. Trump, who polls show had overwhelming support among Midwestern farmers, had promised to back policies that helped agriculture, but his EPA approved sharp increases in the waivers, aiding oil refiners and reducing demand for corn-based ethanol.  Roughly 40% of U.S. corn is used to produce ethanol. The EPA under Trump issued 85 retroactive small refinery exemptions for the 2016-2018 compliance years, undercutting the renewable fuel volumes by a total of 4 billion gallons, (15.1 billion liters) according to the Renewable Fuels Association.  Roughly a month after President Joe Biden took office, his EPA reversed the federal government’s stand, saying the EPA agrees with the appeals court that the exemption was intended to operate as a temporary measure.  “The change reflects the agency’s considered assessment that the Tenth Circuit’s reasoning better reflects the statutory text and structure, as well as Congress’s intent in establishing the RFS program,” the EPA said in a statement.  Biofuels and farm advocates applauded the decision.  “This announcement marks a giant step forward by the new administration to restore the integrity of the Renewable Fuel Standard and honor the statutory intent of the program,” said Renewable Fuels Association President Geoff Cooper.  Iowa Republican politicians, who were loyal supporters of Trump but struggled to defend his administration’s ethanol policy, also supported the Biden administration move.  “This is a step to provide much-needed certainty to ethanol and biodiesel producers,” Sen. Joni Ernst said.  Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds called the decision an “encouraging sign” from the Biden administration.  American Petroleum Institute Vice President Ron Chittim said the group supports the EPA decision “as it follows the 10th Circuit court’s finding and is consistent with Congress’ intent when it enacted the Renewable Fuels Standard.”  The group, which represents a range of companies serving the oil and natural gas industry, advocates for equal treatment among refineries.","EPA changes stand, sides with ethanol industry in court case"

The roughly dozen workers on Palmachim Beach were among thousands of volunteers, soldiers and park rangers who have taken up the task of extracting millions of tiny globs of sticky black tar that have coated the Israeli shoreline in recent days after an oil spill in the Mediterranean Sea. The cleanup is expected to take months. Green bags filled with tar-coated shells and detritus quickly piled up on the beach. The ministry and environmental groups estimate at least 1,000 tons of tar washed up on the coast.  Israel’s Environmental Protection Ministry is investigating the cause of the oil spill, believed to have taken place between Feb. 6-10. On Monday, the ministry released a court-issued gag order on all details of the investigation into the party responsible. The Nature and Parks Authority has called it one of the country’s “worst ecological disasters” to date.  The ministry said it received no prior warning from any international organizations about the spill.  An acrid petroleum filled the air and a black streak at the high tide mark ran the length of the shore. It was just a tiny stretch of an oil slick that has coated almost the entire length of Israel’s 120-mile-long (195-kilometer) coastline.  On Sunday, the ministry urged Israelis to stay away from the beaches, citing serious health hazards posed by the tar. It has caused extensive damage to wildlife.  Project 500, an Israeli initiative akin to the U.S.’s Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression, is funded by the Defense Ministry and has put 500 people left unemployed because of the coronavirus recession to work for the past few months cleaning national parks and nature reserves.  When the oil spill hit last week, the unit — comprised of Jews and Arabs alike from around the country — was mobilized to help with the spill.  Imad Khoury, a Palestinian from Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem who was among those on the beach, said the shared effort was a welcome change from the steady stream of bad news. “This is something different,” he said.  The environmental damage is not restricted to Israel. Farther north, deposits of tar have started washing up in southern Lebanon.  The management of the city of Tyre’s coastal nature reserve, one of Lebanon’s last remaining sandy beaches and an important nesting site for endangered Loggerhead and Green sea turtles, said the spill could endanger marine life and biodiversity in the area. The reserve is one of two marine protected areas in Lebanon and contains a wide diversity of ecosystems and is located on a major bird migration route.  Hassan Hamza, engineer at the Tyre reserve, said teams were evaluating how much tar washed up to organize quick clean ups. He said it appeared that “most Lebanese beaches have been affected by this pollution.”  Caretaker Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab has asked the defense and environment ministers to follow up and said the government was “acting accordingly to repair the damage caused by the leakage.”  Nir Hodeda, a Jerusalem resident who used to work as a cellphone salesman, was working with Project 500 doing restoration at the West Bank site of Qumran — home of the Dead Sea Scrolls — until he was mobilized to Palmachim.  “You’re doing something for nature, not just for a person, for wild animals, for the climate, for the environment, for everyone,” he said.",Volunteers mobilize to clean Israel’s tar-coated beaches

Activists began reporting globs of black tar on Israel’s coast last week after a heavy storm. The deposits have wreaked havoc on local wildlife, and the Israeli Agriculture Ministry determined Sunday that a dead young fin whale that washed up on a beach in southern Israel died from ingesting the viscous black liquid, according to Kan, Israel’s public broadcaster. Israel’s Nature and Parks Authority has called the spill “one of the most serious ecological disasters” in the country’s history. In 2014, a crude oil spill in the Arava Desert caused extensive damage to one of the country’s delicate ecosystems.  The Environmental Protection Ministry and activists estimate that at least 1,000 tons of tar, a product of an oil spill from a ship in the eastern Mediterranean earlier this month, have already washed up on shore. The ministry is trying to determine who is responsible. It declined commenting on details of the investigation because it was ongoing.  Yoav Ratner, coordinator of the ministry’s oil spill contingency plan, said that there were still many “unknown unknowns” about the extent of the ecological damage and therefore it was difficult to say how long clean-up would take.  Thousands of volunteers took to the beaches on Saturday to help clean up the tar, and several were hospitalized after they inhaled toxic fumes. The military also deployed thousands of soldiers to assist in the operation.  The Environmental Protection, Health and Interior Ministries issued a joint statement Sunday warning the public not to visit the entire length of the country’s 120-mile (195 km) Mediterranean coastline, cautioning that “exposure to tar can be harmful to public health.”  Environmental Protection Minister Gila Gamliel told Hebrew media that her department estimates the clean-up project will cost millions of dollars.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu toured one of the country’s tar-pocked beaches on Sunday and praised the ministry’s work.  Representatives from a coalition of Israeli environmental groups said in a press conference on Sunday that the ministry was woefully underfunded and that existing legislation did little to prevent or address environmental disasters. Arik Rosenblum, director of the Israeli environmental group EcoOcean, said that the Environmental Protection Ministry is “fighting this situation and many other situations with their hands tied behind their back” because of inadequate legislation.  They cautioned that this disaster should be a wake-up call for opposition to a planned oil pipeline connecting the United Arab Emirates and Israeli oil facilities in Eilat — home to endangered Red Sea coral reefs.",Israel shuts Mediterranean shore after oil devastates coast

Gas shortages mean they sometimes have to work from home. They even reuse sheets of paper to record field data because fresh supplies are so scarce.  As their country falls apart, a hardy team of scientists in Venezuela is determined to transcend the political and economic turmoil to record what happens as the country’s last glacier vanishes.  Temperatures are warming faster at the Earth’s higher elevations than in lowlands, and scientists predict that the glacier — an ice sheet in the Andes Mountains — could be gone within two decades. “If we left and came back in 20 years, we would have missed it,” says Luis Daniel Llambí, a mountain ecologist at the University of the Andes in Mérida. Scientists say Venezuela will be the first country in South America to lose all its glaciers.  Throughout history, glaciers have waxed and waned numerous times. But the rapid pace of glacial retreat over the past century and a half, accelerated by human activities and the burning of fossil fuels, creates a new urgency — and opportunity — for scientists to understand how freshly exposed rock forms new soil and eventually new ecosystems.  While most of the planet’s ice is stored in the polar regions, there are also glaciers in some mountainous regions of the tropics — primarily in South America.   “Practically all of the high-mountain tropical glaciers are in the Andes. There’s still a little bit on Mount Kilimanjaro,” says Robert Hofstede, a tropical ecologist in Ecuador who advises international agencies such as the World Bank and United Nations.  Monitoring Venezuela’s Humboldt glacier depends on continuous visits, Llambí notes. And even in the best of circumstances, it’s no easy trek from the small mountain town of Mérida to the ice sheet perched within Venezuela’s Sierra Nevada National Park at nearly 16,500 feet (5,000 meters) above sea level.  When Llambí and three other scientists made the journey this spring to scout out mountain terrain for a new research project, they first rode a cable car, then walked a full day to the base camp, pitching their tents in drizzling rain. Each day, they then had to climb an additional three hours to reach the glacier, at times donning helmets and holding tight to ropes to maneuver up steep boulders. Some of the scientists had waterproofed their worn-out old boots using melted candle wax. Mountain fieldwork always is physically grueling, but the deepening crisis in Venezuela since the death of former president Hugo Chavez in 2013 has transformed even simple tasks into immense hurdles.  “Things that you normally take for granted for research — internet, gas, electricity — all become scarce and unpredictable,” Llambí says.  Perhaps the hardest toll has been watching many of their colleagues and students leave, joining the more than 4 million people who have fled Venezuela’s political upheaval in recent years.  “Every week, someone asks me why I haven’t left,” says Alejandra Melfo, a team member who is a physicist at the University of the Andes. Not now, she tells anyone who asks.  “Climate change is real and has to be documented,” she says. “We have to be there.”  The Institute of Environmental and Ecological Sciences at the University of the Andes was founded 50 years ago, in 1969, and the scientists there see themselves as custodians of long-term data monitoring how temperatures and plant life are changing in the region, including in the Andean ecosystem known as the paramos — a mist-covered mountain grassland that lies between the top of the tree line and the bottom of the glacier. While most tundras have sparse vegetation, the paramos is famous for striking plants called frailejones that can be taller than humans and resemble a cross between a cactus and a palm tree. These mountain grasslands also store and release water that sustains the cities and croplands further downslope.  It’s hard to overstate the importance of the Andean glaciers in maintaining regional water cycles.  “More than 50 million people in South America rely on water provision from the Andes,” says Francisco Cuesta, a tropical ecologist at the University of the Americas in Quito, Ecuador, who marvels at the dogged work the team is doing under such punishing conditions.  “To me, it’s incredible that they are still doing research there,” Cuesta says. The region is one of the front lines of climate change. Glaciers in the tropical Andes have been retreating faster than most other glaciers since scientists began keeping detailed records in the 1970s, because tropical latitudes get more direct sunlight and radiation.  When a glacier melts away, at first only bedrock is left behind — sometimes rough gravel and sometimes smooth rock, worn down by centuries or millenniums of grinding ice.  But within a few years or decades, bacteria and lichen began to colonize the area. As they decompose the minerals of the rock and their bodies then decay into organic matter, the first hints of soil begin to form. And soil is the basis of a new ecosystem, providing a structure to retain water and for plant roots to grow.  “The formation of soil is the difference between an ecosystem being able to form quickly and being stalled for hundreds of years,” Llambí says. On the rocks left behind when the glacier retreats, the scientists think that a new ecosystem resembling the paramos may eventually begin to develop. But there are many questions still to answer: Will it take decades to form new soil? Can plant and animal species that thrive at lower elevations also survive further upslope? Will they be able to adapt to continually changing temperatures?  Venezuela has the world’s largest known oil reserves, but an economy hitched for decades to global oil demand has proven unstable. Llambí believes he has a special obligation to help inform the public of the impacts of climate change in a country where the boom-and-bust cycle of fossil fuel exploration has shaped nearly everyone’s life.  “Our university is in Mérida, which has long been called ‘the city of eternal snow,‘” he reflects. “We are discovering that ‘eternity’ is not forever, and that’s what we have to get used to in a world with climate change.”",Hardy Scientists Trek to Venezuela's Last Glacier Amid Chaos

The boards sag, dipping her up to her knees in the tea-colored water.  “This is the treacherous part,” the Florida International University researcher says. “The water levels are up.”  To a layman, this patch of brown-green saw grass and button mangrove deep inside Everglades National Park looks healthy enough, but Troxler knows trouble lurks just beneath the murky surface. She points to a clump of grass: Beneath the water line, the soil has retreated about a foot, leaving the root mass exposed. It is evidence that the thick mat of peat supporting this ecosystem is collapsing — and research suggests encroaching sea water is to blame.   “You can think about these soils as your bank account,” says Troxler, associate director of FIU’s Sea Level Solutions Center. “In the condition that this marsh is right now, the outlook is not good.”  Formed roughly 5,000 years ago, during a time of sea level rise, the Everglades once comprised an area twice the size of New Jersey. “The miracle of the light pours over the green and brown expanse of saw grass and of water, shining and slow-moving below, the grass and water that is the meaning and the central fact of the Everglades of Florida,” journalist and activist Marjory Stoneman Douglas famously wrote in 1947. “It is a river of grass.”  But over the course of just the last century, about half of the Everglades’ original footprint has been lost — plowed under or paved over, never to be recovered, so long as South Florida’s 8 million human inhabitants claim it for their homes, livelihoods and recreation. The glades have been sapped by canals and dams that remapped the landscape and altered animal habitats, polluted by upstream agricultural areas, transformed by invasive species. And now, rising sea levels — this time, caused by man — threaten to undo what it took nature millennia to build.  What survives is not so much a natural ecosystem, but a remnant, heavily dependent on — and at the mercy of — a network of more than 2,100 miles of canals, 2,000 miles of levees and hundreds of floodgates, pump stations and other water-control structures. What the Army Corps of Engineers calls a “highly managed system,” others have sardonically labeled a “Disney Everglades.”  Nearly two decades and $4 billion into the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, an ambitious federal-state program adopted in 2000, new data about the pace of climate change have called into question how much of the Everglades can ever be salvaged — and what that even means. “Here are no lofty peaks seeking the sky, no mighty glaciers or rushing streams wearing away the uplifted land,” President Harry S. Truman said in a 1947 address dedicating Everglades National Park. “Here is land, tranquil in its quiet beauty, serving not as the source of water, but as the last receiver of it. To its natural abundance we owe the spectacular plant and animal life that distinguishes this place from all others in our country.”  At the center of it all was Lake Okeechobee, the Everglades’ 730-square-mile “liquid heart.”  Today, we understand that natural systems like the untouched Everglades provide enormous benefits — water filtration, nurseries for fish and other wildlife, protection from storm surges, even carbon sequestration. But to 19th-century Floridians, all that water — and the mosquitoes and reptiles it harbored — represented an impediment to progress.  And so when Florida became a state in 1845, one of the Legislature’s first acts was to pass a resolution asking Congress to survey the “wholly valueless” Everglades “with a view to their reclamation.” Beginning in earnest during the 1880s, a host of entities set about draining the swamp. They dug canals east and west from Lake Okeechobee, carrying nutrient-laden water that altered the salinity of coastal estuaries and caused toxic algae blooms. They seeded the wetlands from the air with a thirsty, paper-barked Australian tree called melaleuca. The vast custard apple forest that girded the lake’s southern shore was torched, burning so fiercely that it set the very earth on fire.  Peat soils that had accumulated over thousands of years dried up and blew away. The result: At the University of Florida Research Station in Belle Glade, a concrete marker driven through the organic soil down to the limestone substrate shows the ground has sunk 6 feet since 1924.  And still, the tinkering went on.  In the 1960s, the Corps began straightening the meandering, flood-prone Kissimmee River. Lined by wetlands so lush that they were known as “the Little Everglades,” the shallow, 130-mile river was what one wildlife expert called a “nursery ground for sport fishes.” By 1971, engineers had straightened the once free-flowing stream into a 56-mile, 30-foot-deep canal bureaucratically designated as the C-38.  But it was an event in 1928 that, as much as any, altered the Everglades’ course. That year, a hurricane overwhelmed the flimsy dike along Lake Okeechobee’s southern shore, causing a deluge that killed 3,000 people, most of them poor, black farmworkers. The resulting 143-mile, 30-foot-high Herbert Hoover Dike now nearly completely surrounds the lake, permanently severing its connection to the park. The Corps’ primary mandate was to protect people, not the environment. As the narrator put it in the 1950s documentary “Waters of Destiny,” the agency saw itself as victorious in a war against nature:  “Water that once ran wild. Water that ruined the rich terrain. Water that took lives and land. Put disaster in the headlines and death upon the soil. Now, it just waits there. Calm, peaceful. Ready to do the bidding of man and his machines.”  Scientists estimate that more than 650 billion gallons of fresh water a year once flowed south into what is now Everglades National Park. Today, that flow is about 280 billion gallons.  Flash forward to the present day, when many of the same canals and levees and pumps that helped drain the Everglades are now being used to try to save them. Alongside the Everglades Agricultural Area, the 700,000-acre checkerboard of sugar cane and winter vegetable fields south of Lake Okeechobee, huge tracts are being converted to store and clean water for use when and where it is needed.  Perhaps the biggest step toward that end so far is the re-engineering of Tamiami Trail, the east-west highway that essentially has acted as a dike through the heart of the Everglades since the 1920s. Since 2013, workers have elevated 3.3 miles of the roadway, allowing water to flow freely into Shark River Slough, historically the deepest and wettest part of the Everglades.  “We’re starting to see the vegetation respond, and we’re getting more of those marsh grasses, more of those open water sloughs,” says Stephen Davis, senior ecologist with the Everglades Foundation. “I’m very confident that we can restore this ecosystem. And by restoration, I mean enhancing the functionality of what remains.” “We’re on the threshold of seeing whether the previous 20 years of work will pay off,” says William Nuttle, a consultant with the University of Maryland’s Center for Environmental Science who began his career in the marshlands of South Florida.  But time is not on the Everglades’ side.  Over the past decade, scientists began noticing an alarming trend in the wetlands near the park’s southwest tip — “potholes” of open water filled with dead vegetation. Sea water, Nuttle says, was causing vast areas of once-healthy saw grass prairie “to unravel like a moth-eaten wool sweater.”  A lack of fresh water from the north and the intrusion of sea water have boosted salinity levels in the marshes, Troxler and others say, which appears to be hindering plant growth.  Scientists are counting on mangroves and other more salt-tolerant plants to migrate inland into the saw grass plains, establishing a new, natural bulwark against climate change. But that change may already be outpacing nature’s — and man’s — ability to counter it: When the restoration plan was adopted in 2000, its authors were anticipating seas to rise only 6 inches by 2050. They’ve since already risen 5 inches.  In its most recent report to Congress, a panel of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine urged a sweeping reassessment of restoration projects, warning that the current work is lagging behind the pace of climate change and could take 65 years to complete at the current funding levels.  “At this pace of restoration, it is even more imperative that agencies anticipate and design for the Everglades of the future,” they wrote. There are more than 360 species of birds, including the great blue heron and the diminutive green variety, purple gallinules and roseate spoonbills, the white ibis and the black skimmer. It is said to be the only place in the world where freshwater alligators and saltwater crocodiles co-exist.  And then there are the non-native species that are throwing off nature’s balance.  On a blisteringly hot late-October morning, wildlife biologist Ian Bartoszek, who heads the Conservancy of Southwest Florida’s snake research and removal program, sloshes through a cypress swamp outside Naples.  Holding an H-shaped antenna aloft in his right hand, he listens as the signal from the device in his other hand steadily increases. “As the beeps get louder, the giant snake is getting closer,” he says.  Of all the invasive species plaguing the Everglades, the Burmese python is the most high-profile and, arguably, the most intractable. No one is quite sure how a giant snake native to Southeast Asia found its way into the wilds of South Florida in the late 1970s, although many believe the first were escaped — or released — pets. Estimates of their population run into the hundreds of thousands, and they are voracious. In 2015, Bartoszek’s team captured a 31.5-pound female in the process of digesting a 35-pound fawn. In all, the conservancy and its research partners have documented the remains of 23 species of mammal and 43 species of birds in the pythons’ bellies.  Scientists suspect the python is responsible for the disappearance of up to 99 percent of the marsh rabbits, raccoons and other small mammals in the national park.  Pythons can remain underwater for as long as a half-hour, and their black, brown and tan pattern helps them blend into both the marsh and higher sandy ground. All of which makes them almost impossible to find. So, since 2013, Bartoszek has been using pythons to catch pythons.  Every two weeks, he flies over the area, picking up the unique signal of radio transmitters surgically implanted into 25 snakes and plugging their coordinates into a spreadsheet. The hope is that these so-called “Judas snakes” will lead them to others, especially breeding-age females.  This day, they’ve picked up the signal of Python No. 21 — a 50-pound, 11-and-a half-foot male named Johnny Rebel who has helped find 20 adult pythons, including eight females carrying approximately 560 developing eggs.  “He’s an MVP,” Bartoszek says with a grin. “Our most valuable python.”  Bartoszek straps on a machete and, with a nod to Sherlock Holmes — “The game is afoot!” — plunges into the woods. Following deer paths, he and field technician Ian Easterling step over old barbed-wire fences and downed melaleuca trees as the receiver leads them deeper into the brush. The beeping intensifies.  “We’re getting warmer,” Bartoszek says. “This looks snaky right here. This is where I would be.”  “I see a head here!” Bartoszek shouts a few moments later. “Confirm!”  “There’s a snake moving here,” Easterling replies. Diving into the undergrowth, Bartoszek does a double-take: “Hold on a second. … There might be two pythons!”  Johnny, it seems, has found a girlfriend.  After catching their breath, he and Easterling plunge their heads into the thicket, where the fat reptile is coiled up — and staring right at Easterling. “Hi!” he says. “Don’t strike out!”  Easterling grabs the tail as Bartoszek clamps a hand around the snake just behind the head. She is shedding, making it difficult to establish a grip.  “Here comes the pretzel move,” he shouts as the giant reptile writhes, flopping against his thigh with a thud. With a deep groan, she lets go the contents of her digestive tract.  The fight is over. Back in the lab, they weigh and measure their prize: nearly 14 feet long and just over 95 pounds. After putting her in a case and locking her in a storeroom, Bartoszek sifts through her droppings, finding bits of bone and what turn out to be the hooves of a white-tail deer — the primary prey of the Florida panther, an endangered native species.  “It feels like `CSI Crime Scene’ here in this lab sometimes,” he says. “It’s the smoking gun, what’s going on out there in the Everglades.”  In the past six years, the conservancy team has removed more than 500 pythons with a combined weight of about 13,000 pounds from a 50-mile-square area. Despite that success, Bartoszek thinks that total eradication of the Burmese python “is off the table.”  “It seems to be adapting and evolving real time here in the Everglades ecosystem,” he says. “It may be more appropriate to start referring to them as the Everglades python. Because they’re ours now. They’re here.”  ----  When the Everglades restoration plan was adopted in 2000, it aimed to turn back the clock to the pre-drainage wilderness of Douglas’ imagination. But in the face of rising seas, along with fluctuating temperatures and rainfall distribution, experts agree there is no going back. “Everglades restoration has always been an ambitious and complex endeavor,” the National Academies of Sciences panel wrote. “Our current review emphasizes how it is also dynamic and the importance of focusing restoration on the future Everglades, rather than on the past Everglades.”  Earlier this year, an interagency group that includes the Corps of Engineers and the National Park Service issued its latest Everglades System Status Report — and it was not cheery.  “Overall, the Florida Everglades is struggling to survive in the face of sustained pressure from human activities and the increasing impacts of climate change,” the group wrote. “The poor to fair scores reflected in the report card indicate that the region’s ecosystems are degraded and the anticipated ecological benefits of restoration are still to be realized.”Still, there are some hopeful signs.  Some adaptation is taking place. Scientists poking through the bellies of wood storks, an “indicator species” for Everglades restoration, have found evidence that they are feasting on the non-native African jewelfish. And the endangered Everglades snail kite is showing a fondness for an exotic species of the mollusk, another latecomer to the region.  Perhaps the most encouraging development of all is the ongoing $578 million project to restore 40 square miles of the Kissimmee River Basin. Since the demolition of some of the dams, a portion of the river has found its old channel. The wetlands are returning, and so is the wildlife.  Thomas Van Lent, vice president of science and education at the Everglades Foundation, recently took a pontoon boat trip on a 2-mile section of the restored river.  “And there were snail kites everywhere,” he says. “It’s just amazing to see the effects.”   His colleague Stephen Davis believes the plan can provide flood protection — and water for drinking and recreation — while restoring and preserving the Everglades’ original functions.  “I think there are some that think restoration is like restoring an old automobile back to what it looked like and felt like historically,” he says. “That’s not the case with Everglades restoration.”  In 2015, the Corps submitted its most recent report to Congress, estimating the total cost of restoration at $16 billion — about twice the original projection. Unsurprisingly, that figure draws detractors who question such a large outlay being spent with no guarantee of success.  One recent steamy morning, Michael Todd Tillman watched as three massive pumps, running around the clock since spring, spewed water into the L-29 Canal beside the Tamiami Trail at a rate of 250 cubic feet per second.  “They’re about to flood me out,” says the airboat operator, whose family has a recreational camp inside the park.  Tillman says he understands what the engineers are trying to do, but wonders whether he and others could be losing a way of life based on someone’s best guess.  “They made huge mistakes before,” he says. “How do they know this is the right answer now?”  Whatever the final price tag, Nuttle says humans created this “hybrid ecosystem” and that it is up to humans to maintain it — for nature’s sake, and for our own.  “We started in South Florida by declaring war on the ecosystem,” he says. “It’s not restoration that we’re paying for; it’s restitution.”","To Save Everglades, Guardians fight time - and climate"
41,https://apnews.com/article/5283261bea5d4a7ea66e886410436bfc,AP,Centrist,"In the unlikely setting of the world’s most populated military installation, amid all the regimented chaos, you’ll find the Endangered Species Act at work.  There, as a 400-pound explosive resounds in the distance, a tiny St. Francis Satyr butterfly flits among the splotchy leaves, ready to lay as many as 100 eggs. At one point, this brown and frankly dull-looking butterfly could be found in only one place on Earth: Fort Bragg’s artillery range.  Now, thanks in great measure to the 46-year-old federal act, they are found in eight more places — though all of them are on other parts of the Army base. And if all goes well, biologists will have just seeded habitat No. 10.  One of Earth’s rarest butterfly species, there are maybe 3,000 St. Francis Satyrs. There are never going to be enough of them to get off the endangered list, but they’re not about to go extinct either. They are permanent patients of the bureaucratic conservation hospital ward. In some ways, the tiny butterfly is an ideal example of the more than 1,600 U.S. species that have been protected by the Endangered Species Act. Alive, but not exactly doing that well.  To some experts, just having these creatures around means the 46-year-old law has done its job. More than 99.2% of the species protected by the act survive, The Associated Press has found. Only 11 species were declared extinct, and experts say all but a couple of them had already pretty much died out when they were listed.  On the other hand, only 39 U.S. species — about 2% of the overall number— have made it off the endangered list because of recovery, including such well-known successes as bald eagles, peregrine falcons and American alligators.   Most of the species on the endangered list are getting worse. And only 8% are getting better, according to a 2016 study by Jake Li, director for biodiversity at the Environmental Policy Innovation Center in Washington.  “Species will remain in the Endangered Species Act hospital indefinitely. And I don’t think that’s a failure of the Endangered Species Act itself,” Li says. The Endangered Species Act “is the safety net of last resort,” says Gary Frazer, assistant director of ecological services at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which administers the law. “We list species after all other vehicles of protection have failed.”  The act was signed into law by Republican President Richard Nixon on Dec. 28, 1973. It had been passed overwhelmingly — the House voted 355 to 4 in favor and Senate approval was unanimous, margins that seem unthinkable today. The law was designed to prevent species from going extinct and to protect their habitat. It instructed two federal agencies — the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service — to draw up a list of species endangered or threatened with extinction.  Under the law, it is unlawful to “harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture or collect” endangered animals, and it also forbids the elimination of their habitats. At first, only animals were protected, but eventually plants were protected, too.  The law caused all sorts of environmental showdowns in the 1970s and 1980s — most notoriously, the fight over the construction of the Tellico Dam in Tennessee, which threatened the tiny snail darter fish. In the end, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the fish, but Congress exempted the dam from the law.  Now, the act is in contention once again. In September, President Donald Trump’s administration changed the endangered species process in ways that some say weaken the law. Critics say one change would allow costs to industry to be taken into account when deciding how to protect species.  Even putting that aside, the act has its costs. Another species found at Fort Bragg — the red-cockaded woodpecker — is a case in point. In 2016, the last year with per-species spending estimates, the U.S. government spent $25 million on the red-cockaded woodpecker, more than 100 times what it spent on the St. Francis Satyr butterfly. From 1998 to 2016, the federal government spent $408 million on the woodpecker, making it one of the most expensive species on the endangered list.  The small woodpecker is a member of the original class of 1967. It may soon fly off the endangered list or, more likely, graduate to the less-protected threatened list.  “Something is going right,” says Fort Bragg Endangered Species Branch Chief Jackie Britcher, holding a male woodpecker in her hands as a group of biologists stood under trees with giant nets to catch, count and band the birds.  The woodpeckers live only in longleaf pines, which have been disappearing across the Southeast for more than a century, due to development and suppression of fires. When naturally occurring fires were tamped down, other plants and brush would crowd them out.  Unlike other woodpeckers, these birds build their nests in live trees, sometimes taking as long as a decade to drill a cavity and make a home. In the 1980s and 1990s, efforts to save the woodpecker and their trees set off a backlash among landowners who worried about interference on their private property.  “I’ve been run off the road. I’ve been shot at,” says former Fish and Wildlife Service woodpecker official Julie Moore.  Army officials weren’t happy either: They were being told they couldn’t train in many places because of the woodpecker.  “We couldn’t maneuver. We couldn’t shoot because they were afraid the bird was going to blink out and go into extinction,” says former top Fort Bragg planning official Mike Lynch.  By the 1980s, the red cockaded woodpecker population was below 10,000 nationwide, says Virginia Tech scientist Jeff Walters, a woodpecker expert. Biologists built boxes to serve as nests, attaching them to trees. The woodpeckers weren’t interested. Then Walters tried something different. He put the boxes inside the trees. The birds started living in them.  Instead of prohibiting work on land the woodpecker needs, Fish and Wildlife Service officials allowed landowners to make some changes as long as they generally didn’t hurt the bird.  Such “safe harbor” agreements “effectively laid out the welcome mat for endangered species” without burdening the landowner, says former assistant Interior Secretary for Fish, Wildlife and Parks Michael Bean, who wrote the seminal 1977 textbook on endangered species law.  Meanwhile, Army officials were convinced to start setting fires to burn away the scrub. Now about a third of the area burns every three years or so.  The result? When Britcher started, in 1983, there were fewer than 300 families — with about three birds per nest — on Fort Bragg, and the numbers were dropping. Now she counts 453 families on the base and 29 nearby. That’s well over the goal the Army set for itself.  At least 15,000 of the woodpeckers thrive on bases across the Southeast, where they’re best protected and counted regularly, Walters says. The woodpecker is “an umbrella species” biologists say. What helps woodpeckers is good for the St. Francis Satyr butterfly and dozens of other vulnerable species.  And it helps soldiers, too, who now have greatly improved training lands, Lynch notes.  Lynch made that observation in the right field stands of the new Fayetteville, North Carolina, minor league baseball stadium. The name chosen by the community for the first-year team: the Fayetteville Woodpeckers. A community that once hated the bird has now embraced it as their own. From 1998 to 2016, the federal government tallied $20.5 billion in spending on individual species on the endangered list. That’s based on an annual per-species spending report that the Fish and Wildlife Service sends to Congress, but that tally is not comprehensive.  Over that period, more than $7 billion went to two species of salmon alone. (Salmon are expensive, in part, because helping them involves removing dams.) Seven species, mostly fish, ate up more than half of the money expended under the act, according to the annual accounting figures.  About $3 million was spent to save the St. Francis Satyr butterfly.  Nick Haddad — the world’s leading expert on the St. Francis Satyr, a Michigan State University biology professor and author of the book “The Last Butterflies” — got permission to go to the butterfly’s home, the artillery range. He was expecting a moonscape. Instead, he says, “these are some of the most beautiful places in North Carolina, maybe the world.”  Because no one was venturing into the woods there, no one was dismantling beaver dams. No one was snuffing out fires. Aside from lingering fragments of munitions, the landscape was much like North Carolina before it was altered by humans.  The picky butterfly thrives amid the chaos. It needs a habitat that is disturbed, but only a bit. It needs a little bit of water, but not a lot. It needs fire to burn away overgrown plants, but not so much as to burn its food.  The butterfly appears only twice a year for two weeks each time. When it does, Haddad rushes to Fort Bragg and joins a team of Army biologists to count the butterflies and improve their habitat. They install giant inflatable rubber bladders that mimic beaver dams; they produce the minor floods that the butterfly needs. Haddad and his students also tromp through the swamp — on thin planks placed in the water so as not to destroy the delicate leaves the butterfly feeds on — as they count the insects.  “It couldn’t be better than this,” Haddad says, beaming as an egg-bearing butterfly takes flight. “When I see, every year, just a slight change in the right direction of the butterfly’s conservation, let me tell you, that inspires me.”  ___  After years of criticisms from conservatives that the endangered species program isn’t working and is too cumbersome for industry and landowners, President Donald Trump’s administration has enacted 33 different reforms.  Among them: a change in the rules for species that are “threatened,” the classification just below endangered. Instead of mandating, in most cases, that they get the same protection as endangered species, the new rules allow for variations.  That is better management, says the Fish and Wildlife Service’s Frazer, adding, “It allows us to regulate really only those things that are important to conservation.”  While Michael Bean, the former Interior Department official, calls the plan an “unfortunate step back, not catastrophic in its consequences,” Noah Greenwald, endangered species director of the Center for Biological Diversity, characterizes the regulations as “a disaster.”  Li says the exceptions will allow species to be harmed greatly when they move from the endangered category to threatened status — for example, the American burying beetle, which is in conflict with oil and gas interests. The biggest problem, Li and others say, is that new species in trouble aren’t being added to the list. At its current pace, this will be the second consecutive year that more species come off the endangered species list than are added — an unprecedented occurrence.  Meanwhile, scientists across the globe warn of the coming extinction of a million species in the decades ahead.  Nick Haddad is determined that the St. Francis Satyr butterfly won’t be one of them.  Emily Dickinson called hope “the thing with feathers.” For Haddad, it’s about a thing with wings, the law that saved it and the Army officials who enforce that law.  “This is the thing that gives me hope,” Haddad says. “That’s where the Endangered Species Act had an impact.”",Butterfly on a bomb range: Endangered Species Act at Work

But dip beneath the surface — go down 60 or 70 feet — and you’ll find a spectacular seascape. Sponges, barnacles and tube worms cover rocky ledges on the ocean floor, forming a “live bottom.”  Gray’s Reef is little more than a drop in the ocean 19 miles off the Georgia coast, but don’t confuse size for significance. In one of his last official acts, President Jimmy Carter declared the reef a national marine sanctuary at the urging of conservationists who said its abundance of life was unique and worth saving for future generations. For nearly 40 years, the U.S. government has protected the reef, home to more than 200 species of fish and an amazing array of nearly 1,000 different kinds of invertebrates. Recreational fishing and diving are allowed, but commercial fishing and other kinds of exploitation are not.   And Gray’s Reef has served as a global inspiration. Following the lead of the U.S., other nations have designated similar sanctuaries and protected areas, which now cover about 6% of the world’s oceans — a bonanza for researchers but, more importantly, an important tool for safeguarding the seas.  Doubts remain about how much of the ocean they can truly save. Last year was the hottest on record for the planet’s oceans, and protected areas can’t slow the biggest source of that warming — increasing greenhouse gases. The federal government says more than 90% of the warming that has occurred on the planet over the past half-century has taken place in the ocean. That has had dramatic effects in the waters that cover 70% of Earth’s surface. Scientists have tied the warming to the rise of sea levels, the disappearance of fish stocks and the bleaching of corals. The ocean also has become more acidic as humans have released higher concentrations of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and that jeopardizes valuable shellfish and the plankton that form the base of the food chain.  The supporters for the protected areas range from sustenance fishermen on the tiniest islands of the Pacific to researchers at the most elite institutions of academia. “We’re not protecting these areas just for ourselves,” Roldan Muñoz, a research fishery biologist with the U.S.’s National Marine Fisheries Service, says during a research trip to the reef, “they’re for our nation.”  ___  On a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expedition to Gray’s Reef, the federal research vessel Nancy Foster is packed with scientists conducting research on subjects ranging from whether invasive lionfish are present to how changing ocean conditions are affecting coral species. Sanctuary research coordinator Kimberly Roberson and other scientists prepare to dive to collect data about what fish can be found in the area, while Craig Aumack, an assistant professor of biology at Georgia Southern University, peers through a microscope at algae.  Aumack notes that more types of seaweed and tropical species of fish are appearing on the reef as waters warm, like the odd-looking and colorful clown wrasse, a fish native to the Caribbean Sea that was found off the coast of Georgia this summer, most likely pushed hundreds of miles to the north by changing ocean temperatures. The sanctuary is named after Milton “Sam” Gray, a biologist who studied it in the 1960s and identified it as an ecosystem worth saving — a reef not far from the U.S. coast that teemed with life, especially an “abundance of diversity of invertebrates,” Roberson notes.  Without that designation, the habitat could have vanished due to high-impact industries such as bottom-trawl commercial fishing, which are now prohibited there.  “In some ways, it’s a test of what a marine protected area can do for surrounding areas,” says Clark Alexander, director and professor at the University of Georgia Skidaway Institute of Oceanography and a former member of the sanctuary’s advisory board. “It was sort of an ideal spot to preserve this kind of habitat and make it available for research and recreation.”  In the decades since Gray’s was established, large and more stringently protected zones have popped up all over the world.  Phoenix Island Protected Area, established in January 2008, covers more than 150,000 square miles off the tiny island republic of Kiribati and has been cited by scientists for bringing back species of fish in just over a decade. And an area nearly twice as large, the Rapa Nui Marine Protected Area, now surrounds Easter Island after its creation in 2018. Former U.S. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama greatly expanded the U.S.’s protected areas. Bush created the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument off Hawaii and Obama extended it late in his presidency to a whopping 582,578 square miles.  Smaller protected areas, such as the 5,000-square-mile Northeast Canyons and Seamounts National Monument off New England, created by Obama in 2016, also have been established.  Nine years ago, the U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity agreed to the goal of protecting 10% of the world’s oceans by 2020. The UN said in 2017 that it was on its way to meeting that target and that protected areas “contribute substantial social, economic and environmental benefits to society” and “provide food security and livelihood security for some 300 million people.” One commonly cited problem with the protected areas is the difficulty of enforcing rules that restrict commercial fishing and other intrusive industries from vast areas where few people ever venture, particularly in developing parts of the world where resources are limited.  Creating new protected areas without reducing fishing quotas won’t save species, says Daniel Pauly, a professor of fisheries at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.  And that is not a small issue, as some estimates say the number of fish in the ocean was reduced by half from 1970 to 2015, with warming oceans expected to add to that loss.  “Rebuilding will require not just new protected areas, but it will require quotas reduced,” Pauly says.  Many scientists believe protecting broad swaths of the ocean simply might not be enough. Last year, a group of researchers led by University of North Carolina marine ecologist John Bruno published a pessimistic study of the effects of climate change on the world’s marine protected areas. Their findings: those areas will warm by nearly 5 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100, destroying species and marine life despite the existence of protections.  Bruno’s study reflects the reality of coral bleaching in places such as the Great Barrier Reef off Australia, which is heavily protected but still vulnerable to the impacts of a warming world.  It’s a lesson that illustrates the legacy of Gray’s Reef: Protected areas can save pieces of the ocean from extinction, but they can’t save it all.  “If it was up to me, we’d protect about 30% of the ocean,” Bruno says. “We’re just saying we’ve got to directly address climate change with emission reduction. There’s no way around it.”",How a small stretch of ocean stirred a conservation movement

But around the world, people are putting shovels to ground to help it happen.  In a corner of the Peruvian Amazon, where illegal gold mining has scarred forests and poisoned ground, scientists work to change wasteland back to wilderness. More than 3,000 miles to the north, on former coal mining land across Appalachia, workers rip out old trees that never put down deep roots and make the soil more suitable to regrow native tree species. In Brazil, a nursery owner grows different kinds of seedlings to help reconnect forests along the country’s Atlantic coast, benefiting endangered species like the golden lion tamarin.   They labor amid spectacular recent losses — the Amazon jungle and the Congo basin ablaze, smoke from Indonesian rainforests wafting over Malaysia and Singapore, fires set mostly to make way for cattle pastures and farm fields. Between 2014 and 2018, a new report says, an area the size of the United Kingdom was stripped of forest each year. Rebuilding woodland is slow and often difficult work. And it requires patience: It can take several decades or longer for forests to regrow as viable habitats, and to absorb the same amount of carbon lost when trees are cut and burned. “Planting a tree is only one step in the process,” says Christopher Barton, a professor of forest hydrology at the Appalachian Center of the University of Kentucky. And yet, there is urgency to that work — forests are one of the planet’s first lines of defense against climate change, absorbing as much as a quarter of man-made carbon emissions each year.  Through photosynthesis, trees and other plants use carbon dioxide, water and sunlight to produce chemical energy to fuel their growth; oxygen is released as a byproduct. As forests have shrunk, however, so has an already overloaded Earth’s capacity to cope with carbon emissions.  Successful reforestation programs take into account native plant species. They are managed by groups with a sustained commitment to monitoring forests, not just one-off tree planting events. And usually, they economically benefit the people who live nearby — for instance, by creating jobs, or reducing erosion that damages homes or crops. The impact could be great: A recent study in the journal Science projected that if 0.9 billion hectares (2.2 billion acres) of new trees were planted — around 500 billion saplings — they could absorb 205 gigatonnes (220 gigatons) of carbon once they reached maturity. The Swiss researchers estimated this would be equivalent to about two-thirds of man-made carbon emissions since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Other scientists dispute those calculations, while some fear the theoretical promise of tree-planting as an easy solution to climate changes could distract people from the range and scope of the responses needed.  But all agree: Trees matter.  ___  On a spring morning, forestry researcher Jhon Farfan steered a motorcycle through the dense Peruvian jungle, his tires churning up red mud. He was following a narrow path cut by illegal gold miners in the heart of the Amazon, but he was not seeking treasure. Instead, he was on a quest to reforest abandoned gold mines within the world’s largest tropical forest. After three hours of difficult travel, he reached a broad clearing where knee-high saplings stood in rows, their yellow-green leaves straining for the sun. Farfan whipped out a clipboard with a diagram of the saplings planted months earlier, much like a teacher checking attendance.  “The goal is to look for the survivors,” he said.  Within the thick jungle, only a sliver of light escapes to the forest floor. Often more can be heard than seen: a chorus of howler monkeys, the chatter of red-crowned parakeets — reminders that the Amazon is home to more species diversity than anywhere on the planet. But the rainforest is under increasing threat from illicit logging, mining and ranching. In a region of southeastern Peru called Madre de Dios, Farfan’s job involves inspecting lands where the forest has already been lost to illegal mining spurred by the spike in gold prices following the 2008 global financial crash.  To recover the gold, the floor of the jungle was turned upside down. There are no gold seams in the lowland areas of the Amazon, but only flakes of gold washed down from the Andes mountains by ancient rivers, buried beneath the soil.  After cutting and burning centuries-old trees, miners used diesel pumps to suck up deep layers of the earth, then pushed the soil through filters to separate out gold particles. To turn gold dust into nuggets, they stirred in mercury, which binds the gold together but also poisons the land.  Left behind are patches of desert-like land — dry, sandy, stripped of topsoil and ringed by trunks of dead trees. Last December, Farfan and other scientists with the Peru-based nonprofit CINCIA planted more than 6,000 saplings of various species native to this part of the Amazon, including the giant shihuahuaco, and tested different fertilizers.  “Most tree deaths happen in the first year,” Farfan added. “If the trees make it to year five, typically they’re going to be there a long time.”  A study of former gold mines in Peru by scientists at CINCIA and Wake Forest University several years ago found that seedlings transplanted with soil were more likely to survive than “bare-root seedlings,” and the use of special fertilizers also helped growth. Some of the trees tested had absorbed trace amounts of mercury through contaminated soil, but it’s not clear yet how this will affect them.  Since the project began three years ago, the team has planted more than 42 hectares (115 acres) with native seedlings, the largest reforestation effort in the Peruvian Amazon to date. The group is in discussion with Peru’s government to expand their efforts.  “It’s very hard to stop mining in Madre de Dios, since it’s a major activity,” said Farfan. The challenge now: to plant a tree that can grow in this soil.  ___  While scientists struggle with tainted landscapes in the Amazon, activists a continent away are reckoning with flawed past attempts to heal the land.  After miners left West Virginia’s Cheat Mountain in the 1980s, there was an effort to green the coal mining sites to comply with federal law. The companies used heavy machinery to push upturned soil back into place, compacting the mountainside with bulldozers. The result was soil so packed in that rainwater couldn’t seep down, and tree roots couldn’t expand. Companies planted “desperation species” — grasses with shallow roots or non-native trees that could endure, but wouldn’t reach their full height or restore the forest as it had been. On Cheat Mountain and at other former mining sites across Appalachia, more than a million acres of former forests are in similar arrested development.  “It was like trees trying to grow in a parking lot — not many could make it,” said Michael French, director of operations for the Kentucky-based nonprofit Green Forests Work.  The Appalachian highlands once supported a large and unique ecosystem, dominated by 500,000 acres of red spruce forest a century and a half ago. But commercial logging in the late 1800s and later coal mining in the 20th century stripped the landscape, leaving less than a tenth of the red spruce forests intact. Now French and colleagues at Green Forests Work are collaborating with the U.S. Forest Service to restore native Appalachian forests and the rare species they support — by first tearing down other trees.  “We literally go in with a giant plow-like machine and rip the guts out of the soil,” by dragging a 4-foot ripping shank behind a bulldozer, said Barton, the University of Kentucky professor and founder of Green Forests Work. “Sometimes we call it ugly.”  This “deep ripping,” as it’s known, gives rainwater and tree roots a better chance to push down into the soil. A 2008 study found that disrupting the soil on U.S. brownfield sites through this method helped tree growth. After five growing seasons, trees planted on “ripped” sites had more roots compared to those where deep ripping didn’t occur. Trees also grew taller.  The idea of ripping up the ground seemed startling at first. “When we first started, a lot of our colleagues thought we were crazy. But 10 years later, we’re well on our way,” said Shane Jones, a wildlife biologist for the U.S. Forest Service.  Earlier efforts at reforesting old mining sites within West Virginia’s Monongahela National Forest hadn’t fared so well; sometimes, the majority of seedlings died. But in areas where the team has deep-ripped over the last decade, the survival rate of saplings has been around 90%.  Green Forests Work has now reforested around 800 acres within the Monongahela, and it is taking a similar approach to other former mining sites across Appalachia, having reforested around 4,500 total acres since 2009. Their ultimate goal is to restart the natural cycle of the forest — so that scientists’ work becomes invisible again.  ___  Other reforestation crusades are more personal.  Maria Coelho da Fonseca Machado Moraes, nicknamed Dona Graça, runs a tree nursery that grows seedlings of species native to Brazil’s lesser-known jungle — the Atlantic coastal rainforest. She collaborates with a nonprofit group called Save the Golden Lion Tamarin, which works to protect and restore the forest habitat of the endangered namesake monkey. “The Atlantic rainforest is one of the planet’s most threatened biomes, more than 90 % of it was deforested,” said Luis Paulo Ferraz, the nonprofit’s executive secretary. “What is left is very fragmented.”  As she nears 50, Dona Graça says she is furious at what has happened to the forest, which was whittled down to allow for the urban expansion of Rio de Janeiro and other cities.  She deplores “the stupidity and ignorance” of people who have “destroyed most of the trees and continue destroying them. So I’m trying. I can’t do too much, but the little I can do, I try to do it properly to rescue those trees.” And so, between feeding her chickens and raking the leaves, she grows seedlings of rare species — pau pereira, peroba, “trees that people have damaged already, they don’t exist anymore.” She mixes limestone and clay, places it in plastic nursery bags and plants seeds in them; she irrigates them with water and cow urine.  Local replanting efforts — which aim to reconnect fragmented parcels of forest — often use the seedlings from Dona Graça’s nursery, which gives her both income and great satisfaction.  She does this, she said, for posterity. “In the future when I pass away ... that memory I tried to leave for the people is: It’s worth it to plant, to build,” she said.",Difficult but Rewarding work: Planting Trees to Aid Climate Change

Tom Wolf’s administration has begun drafting a regulation that would require automakers to offer electric cars for sale in Pennsylvania as a way to cut emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants that cause lung problems, it said Friday.  At least 12 states already have a requirement for the zero-emission electric vehicles, including neighbors Maryland, New Jersey and New York.  Drafting a regulation and shepherding it through the approval process often takes a year or more.  The rule would help ensure that automakers offer new zero emissions electric vehicle models for sale in Pennsylvania, the Department of Environmental Protection said. Right now, opportunities to test drive and buy electric vehicles in Pennsylvania are limited, it said. The department was unable to say what sort of percentage requirement it will propose, since the regulation hasn’t been drafted yet. Citing data from Atlas EV Hub, the department said electric vehicles were 1.15% of Pennsylvania light-duty vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2020, the most recent data available.  It would not impose specific percentages of electric vehicles at each car dealership, but rather would apply to auto manufacturers and all vehicles delivered for sale in Pennsylvania, the department said.  Programs in other states do not typically apply to smaller manufacturers and medium-sized and larger manufacturers can comply with the requirement through a credit system, in which they earn credits based on the kind of vehicles they deliver.  David Masur, executive director of the Philadelphia-based environmental advocacy group PennEnvironment, said the announcement is important.  “This is good for our planet, good for public health and it’ll be good for consumers because Pennsylvania will get ahead of where the market is naturally heading anyway,” Masur said.",Pennsylvania looks to boost electric vehicle sales
49,https://apnews.com/article/legislation-virginia-environment-bills-pollution-115fbed1c57860db80078b1c0c55158b,AP,Centrist,"A bill that aims to reduce carbon pollution in part by getting more zero-emissions vehicles on the road cleared a key hurdle in the Virginia Senate on Friday.  The measure, considered a top priority this year for environmental advocates, would require that starting in 2024 a certain percentage of new passenger vehicles sold by manufacturers be electric or hybrid electric. The bill is advancing along with several related pieces of legislation, including a measure that would invest public money in rebates for electric vehicle purchasers. “We must address the climate crisis with the urgency and seriousness that this problem demands, and today, Virginia lawmakers did exactly that by passing the Clean Car Standards,” Lena Lewis, energy and climate policy manager for The Nature Conservancy in Virginia, said in a statement. “These standards will simultaneously broaden consumer choice, improve public health, and reduce carbon emissions.”  The mechanism for reaching the mandated vehicle sales threshold — which would start at roughly 8% in 2024 and then increase each year — involves adopting California’s vehicle emissions standards, which are stricter than the federal standard Virginia currently follows. California has had the authority to set its own for decades under a waiver from the federal Clean Air Act.  The program applies to manufacturers, not car dealers. Manufacturers who aren’t in compliance can buy credits from others who have surpassed the target.  Advocates of the bill say some automakers prioritize sending their electric vehicles, or EVs, to states that use California’s standards. They say that’s meant supply isn’t meeting demand, especially outside of northern Virginia.  The hope is that the measure will make it easier and more likely that Virginians will choose a zero-emissions vehicle and in turn help reduce pollution from the transportation sector, which federal data shows is Virginia’s largest source of heat-trapping carbon dioxide.  Walton Shepherd, Virginia policy director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Virginia’s move is another example of momentum for cleaner vehicles accelerating across the U.S.  “Automakers are promising to transform their fleets; the Biden administration is pressing ahead with strong national standards; and states are stepping up to ensure that their consumers benefit, too,” he said in a statement. Lawmakers who have opposed the bill have raised concerns about tying Virginia’s policy to California.  “They’ve had two major utilities go bankrupt in the last 21 years and they’ve had numerous brownouts,” said Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw, the lone Democrat who voted against the measure in a committee hearing. He ultimately voted for it on Friday.  The measure, sponsored by Del. Lamont Bagby, would also have Virginia adopt California’s low-emission vehicle standard, which requires manufacturers to steadily roll out cleaner vehicles over time.  During a hearing on the bill, Don Hall, president and CEO of the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association, said that his association supports the bill with “great enthusiasm.”  “We shall go forward and sell EVs in Virginia with your support,” he said.  The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents most automakers, initially opposed the bill but later adopted a neutral position.  “We will continue working collaboratively with the Commonwealth, the environmental community, our dealers, EV advocates, and others, to address critical funding for important elements,” John Bozzella, the group’s CEO, said in a statement. “That includes consumer incentives, infrastructure development, and state fleet EV adoption.”  The measure now goes back to the House, which must approve changes the Senate made before it can go to Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam.  A member of Northam’s administration has previously said the governor supports the measure.  This year’s push to clean up transportation pollution comes after environmental advocates working with a new Democratic majority tackled carbon pollution in the power sector last year, passing the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which paved the way for an enormous expansion of renewable energy generation.",‘Clean cars’ bill clears major hurdle in Virginia Senate

The Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy said officials with the AltEn ethanol plant near Mead has submitted a plan to clean up the spill, the Lincoln Journal Star reported. On Feb. 12, plant officials reported the accidental discharge that happened after a frozen pipe on the side of a large digester tank burst, releasing manure from the nearby feedlot and thin stillage from the ethanol plant.  Because the plant uses treated seed instead of harvested grain, it’s likely the thin stillage is contaminated with pesticides, which have been detected in the plant’s lagoons and other waste byproducts at high concentrations.  State regulators arrived on site of the spill about 10 hours after it was reported to find dark-colored wastewater still rushing from the ruptured pipe. The state’s report indicates company officials believed 4 million gallons of the wastewater — some of it in the tanks for three years — was released.  AltEn employees built makeshift dams in several ditches on the facility’s property, as well as downstream, to try hold back the heavy flow of wastewater, the report said.

House lawmakers on Thursday approved a separate bill that would tap $150 million of that broadband funding. The initiative would also use $50 million to promote Ohio to a “national audience” in a PR campaign meant to bring new residents to the state as well as convince former residents to return.

It’s not what’s happening to climate or sea level rise. It’s all going to impact us.”  The planet’s problems are so interconnected that they must be worked on together to be fixed right, Warren said. And many of the solutions, such as eliminating fossil fuel use, combat multiple problems including climate change and pollution, she said. The report “makes it clear that there is no time for linear thinking or tackling problems one at a time,” said University of Michigan environment professor Rosina Bierbaum, who wasn’t part of the work.  In another break, this report gives specific solutions that it says must be taken.  This report uses the word “must” 56 times and “should” 37 times.

That’s why the word ‘must’ is in there,” Figueres said.  The report calls for an end to fossil fuel use and says governments should not tax labor or production, but rather use of resources that damages nature.  “Governments are still playing more to exploit nature than to protect it,” Guterres said. “Globally, countries spend some 4 to 6 trillion dollars a year on subsidies that damage the environment.”  Scientists should inform leaders about environmental risks “but their endorsement of specific public policies threatens to undermine the credibility of their science,” said former Republican Rep.

The 5-2 ruling reversed a lower court decision from 2019 that said officials had failed to adequately consider potential damage to nearby streams from Hecla Mining Co.’s proposed Rock Creek Mine.  The mine beneath the Cabinet Mountains Wilderness near Noxon would employ about 300 people and cover almost 500 acres (202 hectares).  The state Department of Natural Resources and Conservation was sued by the Clark Fork Coalition, Earthworks and other environmental groups after granting the water permit in 2018. A spokesperson for the natural resources department said in a statement that the decision was important for water users who rely on its interpretation of state law.  “The majority ruling confirms that the Department’s analysis of water rights does not interfere with the fundamental right to a clean and healthful environment,” spokesperson John Grassy said.  Opponents argued more review of the project was needed because water flowing into mining tunnels would deplete or completely drain multiple streams in violation of state water quality laws.  But a majority of justices said in a 75-page ruling that further review was not immediately required, in part because the state Department of Environmental Quality had not raised objections to the permit.  Attorney Katherine O’Brien with Earthjustice, who represented the environmentalists, expressed disappointment with the ruling. She said the mine also threatens populations of bull trout and other native fish, grizzly bears and lands that are sacred to the Ktunaxa Nation of Canada.  Hecla Mining Company vice president Luke Russell said the Coeur d’Alene, Idaho-based company was pleased with the decision upholding the permit. Before mining can proceed, the company still needs to resolve a separate legal challenge over potential impacts to imperiled species that is pending before U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy in Missoula.  “We’re doing everything we can to be ready and have agency approvals ready to move forward as soon as we can,” Russell said.

Newman’s car this week will be stark white with a grey Castrol badge and muted logos from partners that supported the initiative. It created a clean look that symbolizes the minimalistic path to carbon neutrality. Castrol in its sponsorship negotiations with RFR mandated a contract clause that the team work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and offset the balance.  “We’ve spent months tracking, quantifying, measuring our existing carbon footprint and ways to reduce our carbon footprint,” RFR President Steve Newmark said. “There’s no doubt that we have unavoidable carbon emissions in how we operate our business. When you race cars and travel around the country to do so, that will inevitably be part of our operations.  “We’re trying to show that even companies in an industry like ours can take steps to reduce overall emissions, and, our hope is that it will set an example for other teams and the racing industry.”  To become carbon neutral, RFR set a goal to recycle 90% of every race car, including oil, rubber, aluminum and carbon fiber. The organization has reduced its overall waste produced to more than 100 tons over the last decade, switched to LED lighting throughout its campus, reduced energy consumption costs through computer-controlled HVAC systems and installed reflective roofing membranes to reduce solar heat gain.  Rainwater runoff at its North Carolina facility is captured and contained for landscape irrigation, and idling has been prohibited on campus to reduce emissions and air pollutants. The fleet of Roush company cars is being converted to Ford electric and hybrid vehicles. Newman already has the all-electric Mustang Mach-E, the first Ford production developed from ground-up to produce a zero-emission vehicle.  “We as a society have to take notice to make an impact,” Newman said. “I’ve never been one to pride myself in driving around an electric vehicle but the reality is that makes a big impact. I’m a V8 (engine) guy with the rumble and a hot rod sounds good, looks good, and take the kids for ice cream in it — that’s me, right?  “The reality is that comes with a cost to our environment and I’m aware of that more so than ever. There are things that we can all be doing better.”  Newman noted that once a week he picks up 15 gallons of trash from the road in front of his North Carolina farm. He fills 5-gallon buckets with wrappers, bottles, beer cans and bags from fast food restaurants and convenience stores.  “It’s sad that people can be that nasty,” Newman said. “Their mindset has nothing to do with greenhouse gasses, or carbon footprints and offsets. They are more worried about not having trash on the floor of their car. They don’t care about what they are driving, they don’t care if it has a catalytic converters, they don’t care if the oil has been changed or what happened to the oil after.  “It’s a challenge and the whole message here is that you don’t have to do that. You can be efficient. You just have to be smarter.”",Roush Fenway becomes 1st carbon neutral NASCAR team

Edward Bartell and Bartell Ranch LLC say the Bureau of Land Management relied “entirely upon flawed and error-laden findings” in environmental assessments prepared by the mine’s own contractor.  Bartell maintains the review masks the real effects that he says would lower the groundwater table, harm the federally protected Lahontan cutthroat trout and imperiled greater sage grouse and “transform much of our private lands into barren desert.” A consultant for Lithium Nevada Corp., a subsidiary of the Canada-based Lithium Americas Corp., prepared “a one-sided, deeply-flawed” analysis of the project, according to the lawsuit filed last week in U.S. District Court in Reno.  “The project consultants relied upon grossly inaccurate, incomplete, and inadequate data for constructing baselines and models purporting to estimate impacts to water resources” caused by groundwater pumping associated with the mine, it said.  The lawsuit said the data flies in the face of earlier water reviews in the area by the bureau, trout population studies by the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Nevada Department of Wildlife and the bureau’s own grouse protection strategy.  “BLM has wholesale ignored the inconsistency of the mine with BLM’s sage grouse plans and associated regulations,” the lawsuit said, noting the project borders one of Nevada’s largest remaining populations of greater sage grouse.  Bureau spokeswoman Heather O’Hanlon said in an email the agency doesn’t comment on pending litigation.  Alexi Zawadzki, CEO of Lithium Nevada Corp., defended the bureau’s approval of its plans in a statement to AP Wednesday night.  “The environmental analysis confirmed the proposed mine would be constructed and operated in an environmentally responsible manner, and we are confident that the full environmental review and mitigation measures included in the (bureau’s decision) will address the concerns raised by this judicial review,” he said.  The Thacker Pass mine is planned on federal land above an extinct volcano formed millions of years ago about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of the Nevada-Oregon line. It’s projected to produce 1,000 jobs during construction and 300 once completed, generating $75 million in state and local tax revenue over a decade.  The bureau issued a final environmental impact statement and record of decision approving the mine in December, subject to additional permitting at the state level.  In addition to robbing Bartell Ranch of its grazing and water rights in the high-desert, the lawsuit said the project threatens trout habitat that Bartell Ranch “has gone to great lengths to protect.” Among other things, Bartell has moved cattle away from fish habitat, altered grazing rotations and built fences to protect streams.  The agency’s refusal to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service to determine whether the mine could harm trout is a violation of the Endangered Species Act, the lawsuit said. Lahontan cutthroat trout were listed as endangered in 1970 and are currently considered threatened.  Bartell Ranch was held to a higher standard when it joined with the bureau and the Fish and Wildlife Service to construct about 3,000 feet (914 meters) of fence in 2017 to keep cattle out of a creek with threatened trout.  While the bureau stopped short of launching a formal “Section 7 consultation” with the Fish and Wildlife Service, its environmental review of that project noted the fencing was consistent with a nearby fuels management project and that “USFWS concurred (the) project will not adversely affect Lahontan cutthroat trout.”  “This satisfies Section 7 consultation requirements for this project,” the bureau said at the time.  But when Bartell’s lawyers pressed the agency to explain why it didn’t consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service about the much larger mining project, the lawsuit says its only response was that effects on trout “are not anticipated to occur from the project, therefore, no formal Section 7 consultation was required.”  That position is directly at odds with well-studied trout populations within the proposed area, the lawsuit says. It says the bureau acknowledged in other parts of its environmental impact statement that the mine could result in “modifications to existing water rights, the potential for mine-related groundwater aquifer drawdown, contamination of groundwater from unintended materials releases (spills) and the potential for adverse effects to groundwater.”",Nevada rancher sues to block lithium mine near Oregon line

Progressive California has long been a leader in combating climate change, requiring solar panels on new homes and passing a law to make the nation’s most populated state rely entirely on renewable energy by 2045. But environmental groups say California officials — particularly governors — have long had a blind spot for the oil and gas industry, which has wielded its immense political power many times to kill or weaken legislation aimed at curtailing production.  That could be changing. Last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom announced steps to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars and called on lawmakers to go further by banning new permits for fracking, a technique to extract oil and gas embedded in rock deep beneath the surface that climate groups say harms the environment and threatens public health.  Two state senators answered that call Wednesday, announcing a measure that would halt new fracking permits or renewals by Jan. 1 and ban the practice altogether by 2027. Democratic state Sens. Scott Wiener of San Francisco and Monique Limon of Santa Barbara also say they will change the bill next month to halt new oil and gas permits within 2,500 feet (762 meters) of homes or schools by Jan. 1.  “This is real. It is harming so many people, and the time to deal with it in the future is over. We need to deal with it now,” Wiener said.  The oil and gas industry quickly pushed back. Catherine Reheis-Boyd, president and CEO of the Western States Petroleum Association, said the legislation was “so broad and ambiguous” it would “lead to a total (oil) production ban in California.”  Rock Zierman, CEO of the California Independent Petroleum Association, called the measure “legally questionable.”  “Shutting down energy production under the toughest regulations on the planet will devastate the economies of oil-producing regions,” Zierman said.  Newsom, speaking at an unrelated news conference in the Coachella Valley, said he had not read the proposal yet and was “unable to comment on it.”  California was among the top oil-producing states in the country, reaching a peak of 394 million barrels in 1985. But by 2017, production had dropped significantly, and it now ranks behind Texas, North Dakota, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Colorado and Alaska, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Part of the reason is the industry has exhausted much of California’s easily extractable oil reserves. What’s left is embedded deep in rock underground that requires immense energy to extract. That includes using processes like fracking, cyclic steaming, acid well stimulation and water and steam flooding to separate the oil from the rock — all processes that would be banned by 2027 under the new legislation.  “It’s some of the dirtiest oil in the world,” said Hollin Kretzmann, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute.  Environmental groups say those methods can cause significant harm to air quality and water supplies. Research published this month by a team at Harvard University estimated that 8.7 million people worldwide died prematurely from fossil fuel pollution in 2018, including 34,000 people in California, the Desert Sun in Palm Springs reported.  “We must stop doing what we know causes death and disease,” said Dr. Karina Maher, a pediatrician in Los Angeles who works with the advocacy group Climate Health Now.  But critics say halting the state’s oil production won’t stop the state’s reliance on oil because millions of people still drive gas-powered cars. State Sen. Shannon Grove, a Republican whose district includes parts of Kern County, said that if the bill becomes law, it would force the state to “rely on foreign countries with dismal human rights records that barely let women drive and have little to no regard for the environment.”  Republican Assemblyman Vince Fong, who also represents Kern County, said California produces oil “in the most environmentally responsible way.”  “At a time like now, when we need to be revitalizing our economy, I don’t quite understand why we would be pushing legislation that eliminates jobs in our state,” he said.  California has more than 5,500 oil wells that have likely been abandoned and could cost more than half a billion dollars to clean up, according to an assessment by the California Council on Science and Technology. For companies that eventually do that work, the legislation would require the state to offer them undefined “incentives” to hire laid-off oil and gas workers.  Wiener says it makes sense to start preparing for the eventual decline of the oil and gas industry and try to avoid the fate of the coal industry, whose decline has devastated communities in the Appalachian region.  “It’s a declining industry. And instead of waiting for it to eventually decline and fall apart, let’s get ahead of it, facilitate the phasing out and help the workers,” Wiener said.",California lawmakers propose ban on fracking by 2027

Jim Justice must pay $270,000 to a nonprofit land protection group and comply with selenium discharge limits under a settlement approved by a federal judge.  U.S. District Judge David Faber approved the settlement Wednesday, two months after environmental groups filed the proposed agreement with Bluestone Coal Corp., the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported.   Last year Faber found the company liable for selenium discharges into waters near a McDowell County mine. High selenium concentrations can be toxic to humans and animals.  Under the agreement, Bluestone must provide quarterly progress reports on pollutant discharge monitoring to several environmental groups, which had sued under the federal Clean Water and Surface Mining Control and Reclamation acts.  The company also must pay a $30,000 federal fine and $270,000 to the West Virginia Land Trust to help finance development of a trail along the Tug Fork of the Big Sandy River. Bluestone already has paid $414,500 for selenium violations from June 2018 to June 2020.  Bluestone had unsuccessfully sought to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that a 2016 agreement between Southern Coal Corp. — another company owned by the Justice family — and the federal Environmental Protection Agency precluded environmental groups from filing the selenium lawsuit.  The five-year-old agreement required Southern to undertake pollution control measures at mines in West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama.  In 2015, Justice completed a $5 million buyback of Bluestone Coal from Russian company Mechel OAO. Just six years earlier, Justice had sold the same mines to Mechel for $436 million in cash in a deal that also off-loaded $132 million in debt. Mechel then laid off many of the mines’ workers.

The renewed request comes as federal installations in New Mexico and South Carolina face a deadline of making 80 cores per year by 2030, with the first 30 due in five years.  With jobs and billions of dollars in spending at stake, the effort to modernize the nation’s nuclear arsenal has enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress over the years, especially among New Mexico Democrats whose districts stand to benefit from the economic windfall. The Biden administration has taken swift action to reverse some policies by the Trump administration but has yet to say whether it plans to push ahead with making more plutonium cores. It does say that work is being reviewed. Nuclear Watch New Mexico, South Carolina-based SRS Watch and California-based Tri-Valley Communities Against a Radioactive Environment sent a letter to the U.S. Energy Department last week, asking that a rigorous environmental review be done before production is ramped up at Los Alamos National Laboratory in northern New Mexico and the Savannah River Site near Aiken, South Carolina.  The groups have cited provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, saying plutonium core production would significantly increase the amount of radioactive and toxic wastes generated at the two locations and that the collective environmental effects need to be considered.  “We are hopeful that a review of programs with significant environmental impacts under NEPA will return to normalcy with the new presidential administration,” said Leslie Lenhardt, an attorney with the South Carolina Environmental Law Project, which is representing the groups.  She said the Energy Department and the National Nuclear Security Administration have a new opportunity to revisit their Trump-era refusal for a more thorough environmental review.  The nuclear security agency said in an email to The Associated Press that the issues raised by the groups were considered during previous public participation opportunities.  The agency opted last fall to prepare a supplemental analysis of an environmental review done for Los Alamos more than a decade ago despite criticism that ramping up production at the lab goes beyond those initial plans and should be reexamined. A separate review was done for Savannah River. National Nuclear Security Administration spokeswoman Ana Gamonal de Navarro said the decisions were consistent with the agency’s legal obligations and there has been no guidance to revisit the decisions amid the presidential transition.  But she also noted that it’s common for programs and activities to be reviewed under new leadership.  “NNSA’s approach to plutonium pit production will be included in this review process,” she said. “Until such a review is completed, NNSA will continue its current overall pit production timeline and strategy.”  U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez’s office said the New Mexico Democrat feels strongly that the federal government should do everything possible to protect the health and wellness of Los Alamos employees and the rest of the community.  “They must ensure that the public has confidence in the lab’s safety and all environmental impact decisions are done according to the law, science and are in the best interest of New Mexican families and stakeholders,” said Maria Hurtado, a spokeswoman for the new congresswoman.  The city of Santa Fe and Santa Fe County in January passed resolutions seeking further study.  Watchdog groups have raised concerns about contamination if new plutonium warhead factories are established in New Mexico and South Carolina that resemble the Rocky Flats facility in Colorado, which had a long history of leaks, fires and environmental violations and needed a $7 billion cleanup that took years to finish.  The mission of producing the plutonium cores began at Rocky Flats in the 1950s and was eventually moved to Los Alamos in the late 1990s. Dogged by safety problems and concerns about a lack of accountability, production at Los Alamos has happened in fits and starts over the years. It’s been shut down at times, and only a handful of prototypes were made in fiscal year 2019.  The cost of the work also has spurred criticism. A 2019 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office estimated that expanded pit production plans could cost up to $9 billion over the next decade but that the estimate was very uncertain. The Government Accountability Office last year pointed to National Nuclear Security Administration and independent studies that have cast doubt on the agency’s ability to prepare the two planned factories in time.",Groups ask Biden for wider environmental review of nuke work

Investigating magistrates in Paris held a videoconference hearing last month with representatives of consumer, farm and environmental groups gathered in a Martinique courtroom to determine how to proceed on a complaint that had languished since 2006.  “I have never given up,” said attorney Harry Durimel, speaking in a phone interview from Guadeloupe. “This is a serious matter that merits everyone’s involvement.” The complaint focuses on chlordecone, a pesticide also known as Kepone that was banned in the U.S. in 1976 following several notorious incidents, including the contamination of the James River in Virginia, and which is blamed for neurological problems including slurred speech.  French health authorities have expressed concern it could be linked to high rates of prostate cancer on the eastern Caribbean islands and some studies have suggested it may be linked to premature births.  It was legally marketed in France from 1981 until 1990 and was used for three more years in Guadeloupe and Martinique to fight the banana weevil under an exemption granted by the French government.  Durimel and other attorneys argue that exemption was illegal. The suit accuses the French government of failing to protect the health of its people and not doing enough to identify and limit the effects of chlordecone pollution on both islands, with a combined population of some 750,000.  “They poisoned us in silence,” Durimel said.  France’s Ministry of the Overseas did not return a request for comment.  Durimel said France considers the pesticide to be so risky that in October 2002, it ordered the incineration of 1.5 tons of sweet potatoes that arrived at the port of Dunkirk from Martinique because they contained chlordecone.  The pesticide degrades slowly, with some experts estimating that the pollution in Martinique and Guadeloupe will last for decades or even centuries after its ban.  In Martinique, authorities temporarily banned fishing in all rivers and some coastal areas in 2009 after finding nearly all fish sampled were still contaminated. U.S. studies in the James River found tainted fish decades after Kepone was banned.  French officials had earlier prohibited the sale of any goods containing chlordecone and ordered that all soil be analyzed before the cultivation of root vegetables. But the complaint says those measures were not enforced and did not carry heavy penalties. In 2002, authorities seized several tons of chlordecone in Martinique and Guadeloupe. “In the end it appears that the state has failed miserably in its mission to protect public health,” according to the complaint filed by Guadeloupe’s Regional Consumers Union; SOS Environment Guadeloupe; the Agriculture, Society, Health, Environment group, and the Union of Agricultural Producers of Guadeloupe.  A 2015 article in the Environmental Science and Pollution Research journal summarized longstanding effects of the pesticide: “From 1999 to date, measurement of chlordecone in blood samples has revealed that a large proportion of the French West Indies population is still contaminated.”  It noted that 88% of samples collected from 100 adult men in Guadeloupe in 1998 contained chlordecone, and in 2004, chlordecone was detected in 87% of 122 women who were pregnant in Guadeloupe and in 77% of breast milk samples.  Years later, a study from 2005 to 2007 in Guadeloupe, found chlordecone in 67% of 623 men diagnosed with prostate cancer, according to the article.  It expressed concern about exposure during pregnancy and infant development “and possibly long-term effects such as cancer.”  France has made several efforts to fight chlordecone contamination, and the most recent plan, to be launched in the coming weeks, has a $112 million budget, triple that of the previous plan, according to French officials. Proposed measures for the next six years include analyzing tap water, taking blood samples and monitoring people’s exposure levels. Officials also plan to map soils to identify the most contaminated areas.  But many activists remain unsatisfied, and the French government itself noted in a previous evaluation that multiple areas needed improvement,  The future of the slow-moving case isn’t clear. The High Tribunal magistrates in Paris said some evidence has disappeared and suggested the statute of limitations might have expired on some alleged damage caused by the pesticide. No date for a follow-up hearing was set.  The plaintiffs’ attorneys are demanding that officials find the missing documents and argue there is no statute of limitations in the case.  “While the complaint against the government doesn’t specify possible remedies, Durimel said he envisions a fund to aid victims: “The goal is that those who polluted, pay.”  Alfred Marie-Jeanne, president of Martinique’s executive council, wrote French President Emmanuel Macron last month saying he was stunned by the report of missing evidence and a possible time limit on damages suffered by people in Martinique and Guadeloupe.  “They feel they have been betrayed by the state and abandoned by those who should have defended them,” he wrote.",French Caribbean fights to keep pesticide case alive

Now, as the coronavirus pandemic surges, legislators are trying to break their agency apart.  As in most states, South Carolina’s public health agency was underfunded and overworked long before it had to sustain an exhausting defense against a virus humans had never seen before. Criticism has mounted from all sides since then — over a slow rollout of testing, the agency’s refusal to release detailed data on early cases, and for seeming to sideline its top epidemiologist.  Now a new director has stepped into what many see as a leadership vacuum, but lawmakers intent on dismantling the Department of Health and Environmental Control aren’t cutting him much slack.  Dr. Edward Simmer is the first medical doctor to helm the agency in nearly four decades — a fact that surprises Simmer himself. He told The Associated Press in an interview that he’ll put science at the center of his dealings with the public, the legislature and the governor.  “Obviously, there are political aspects to what DHEC does. My focus is to be as apolitical as we can be,” Simmer said.  Unlike most public health agencies, South Carolina’s portfolio has included environmental regulation since the 1970s. It now has nearly 4,000 employees, overseeing everything from water quality, dams and landfills to hospitals and vaccine distribution.  The sprawling agency only indirectly answers to elected officials, through an eight-member board appointed by the governor. State officials have said for years that it has become too powerful and unmanageable.  Lawmakers have accused the agency of failing to advocate forcefully enough for prevention measures or to push back on Republican Gov. Henry McMaster’s decisions to reopen businesses. They said DHEC staff shirked responsibility by letting the board decide how to allocate limited vaccines; that the board, comprised mostly of businesspeople and just one doctor, lacks transparency; and that board members moved too slowly to find a new director after the last one quit, mid-pandemic.  Senate President Harvey Peeler is ready to split DHEC apart, bundling public health duties with the state’s mental health department and funneling environmental permitting operations to other state agencies. McMaster has said he supports breaking up DHEC as well. “No one is in control at DHEC and hasn’t been for quite some time,” Peeler declared in December when he announced the bill that would restructure the agency.  Public health agencies have become political scapegoats nationwide after years of inadequate funding, and a lack of federal leadership and coordination has made responding to the pandemic even more difficult, said Simon Haeder, a professor of public policy at Penn State.  In some other states with Republican-controlled legislatures such as Michigan, Montana, Ohio and Oklahoma, lawmakers are looking to curb the powers of proactive state and local health departments.  In South Carolina, the prevailing sentiment is a desire to make the agency more effective, after the response has been hamstrung by a series of politically-appointed directors who didn’t last and other staff turnovers.  “You can make all the structural changes you want, but you’ve got to pick people who are really good at this,” said former Gov. Jim Hodges, who served from 1999 to 2003.  Sen. Dick Harpootlian, a Columbia Democrat who has railed against the agency’s refusal to shut down businesses flouting public health guidelines, said the plan to split DHEC is a “distraction” and it’s the board that ought to be replaced: “They’ve been useless. Useless is an understatement.”  There are signs that other basic agency functions are falling through the cracks.  Lapsed water pollution permits at three of the state’s coal plants had languished for about a decade before environmentalists sued the agency last summer to do its job. The agency finally agreed in January to review the permits.  “Abdicating your responsibility to make sure you’re protecting the citizens of the state from pollution is a pretty serious deficiency,” said Amy Armstrong of the South Carolina Environmental Law Project.  More recently, a computer system switchover left families and funeral homes without death certificates, as bodies awaiting cremation stacked up in at least one funeral home, The Post and Courier reported.  Still, people who’ve worked closely with the agency say splitting up DHEC without adequate funding and staffing will only make problems worse, and that trying to do so during a pandemic is ill-timed.  If anything, the agency’s two sides should coordinate even more closely as hazards to human health increase due to climate change and other environmental threats, said John Simkovich, a regional director of public health who left in 2013.  Public health resources were slashed by lawmakers during the Great Recession, and board members’ terms lapsed under Gov. Mark Sanford. His successor, Gov. Nikki Haley, remade the board, and Catherine Templeton, previously tapped by Haley to trim jobs at the state’s labor department, was named director. Templeton initiated more cuts, centralizing offices and laying off seasoned staffers.  Dr. Robert Ball, one of the state’s top infectious disease epidemiologists until 2012, said morale went downhill after Templeton arrived, prompting an exodus of longtime employees that rapidly drained institutional knowledge.  Salaries remain relatively low for trained health professionals and scientists, so younger staffers quickly move on to earn more elsewhere, former employees say.  Simmer told lawmakers who confirmed him this month that he believes the agency’s environmental and public health halves complement each other. He asked senators to give him a year on the job to figure out reforms before they try to take the agency apart.  So far, he said, no one has promised him that time.",South Carolina considers breaking up public health agency

The state also ordered AltEn to dispose of its leftover grain by March 1, either by dumping it in a licensed landfill or incinerating it. The leftover grain can’t be used as cattle feed because the facility uses seed corn, which is coated in pesticides and herbicides.

The opposition groups argue that the road would negatively affect wildlife in the region, which includes the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Metal mining is the leading source of toxic releases in the state, according to a 2018 analysis conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The Ambler Road would connect Dalton Highway to a region of northwestern Alaska where there are several large metal mining prospects, the Anchorage Daily News reported Thursday.  Ambler Metals, a firm co-owned by mining companies in Canada and Australia, will contribute the other $35 million into pre-constructing the mine road.  Ambler Metals told the Daily News that CEO Ramzi Fawaz was unavailable to talk by phone Wednesday.

70,https://apnews.com/article/environment-indiana-wetlands-bills-876d6fe8cd802b1727440bd08611ccd6,AP,Centrist,"As Indiana lawmakers debate dozens of bills addressing environmental matters, tensions are flaring over whether the state should adopt greener initiatives or step back current policy affecting water, energy and other resources.  While some measures in the General Assembly could bring reductions to Indiana’s carbon emissions and make stricter penalties for polluters, others would spur regulatory rollbacks that environmental advocates say could have long-lasting and damaging effects.  Among the most contested is a bill seeking to remove protection from Indiana’s already diminished wetlands. If passed, the measure would repeal a 2003 law requiring the Indiana Department of Environmental Management permit activity in a state-regulated wetland and end enforcement proceedings against landowners allegedly violating current law. The proposal comes as President Joe Biden’s administration begins review of the previous administration’s rules like the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, which narrowed the definition of waterways that fall under federal protection.  Republican bill author Sen. Chris Garten and other sponsors said vague language in the state law, over-enforcement by state regulators and high mitigation fees that drive up housing costs prompted the drafting. They contend removal of state protections would help developers and grow the housing market.  Environmental groups pushed back, arguing that because wetlands provide water purification, habitat for wildlife and reduced flood risks, it’s critical they’re protected.  Indra Frank with the Hoosier Environmental Council told legislators that because it’s also not clear how many acres of isolated wetlands are in the state, “we don’t know for certain how many acres of wetlands would be in jeopardy.”  Although Garten maintained there would be “zero impact” on overall water quality, the proposed rollbacks have sparked bipartisan opposition within the Republican-dominated Legislature and from Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb.  The governor said Wednesday that while he doesn’t want to hamper Indiana’s economic recovery, the bill is cause for “concern.” He advanced those reservations last month, allowing staff at the departments of natural resources and environmental management to oppose the bill in hearings.  “These are agencies with the expertise on not just the intended consequences (of repealing wetlands protections) but the unintended consequences, as well,” Holcomb said. Regulatory officials testified in the Senate Environmental Affairs Committee that the proposal would take away the state’s ability to protect wetlands, undermining years of work in flood prevention and water quality efforts.  IDEM representative Erin Moorhous emphasized that only 15% of Indiana’s wetlands remain from what existed 200 years ago. About 80% of the remaining wetlands would be at risk under the bill.  Senators passed the bill to the House in a 29-19 vote; nine Republicans and 10 Democrats voted no.  In a state still dependent on coal despite a shift toward renewable energy sources, lawmakers are also debating how Hoosiers get energy.  Republicans have said their proposals address stability and reliability on the electrical grid. Environmental and consumer groups, however, worry that legislation could stall the growth of wind and solar power while propping up the coal industry.  One House bill under consideration by the Senate aims to ensure reliable electricity, requiring electric utilities to annually show how they plan to provide reliable energy to their customers for the next three years.  Those that can’t meet peak demands would be required by the Utility Regulatory Commission to develop a plan to bridge that gap, which could include building a new power plant or solar farm, though Republican bill author Rep. Ed Soliday said the bill doesn’t favor any one source.  “Whether it’s coal, wind, natural gas, or rabbits on a treadmill — it doesn’t matter to us,” he said. “The bill just assures you have a reliable electricity.”  Chairman of the House utilities committee, Soliday has in previous sessions introduced bills that would have slowed the transition to renewable energy sources like wind and solar, which provided just roughly 7 percent of the state’s electricity in 2019.  Soliday said he’s “not particularly a friend of renewables or coal,” but pointed to another of his bills that could make the state “friendlier” to renewable energy.  That measure would create standards for where commercial wind and solar projects can be located, which Soliday said is part of an effort to attract renewable energy industry to areas where local regulations are often more stringent. The 31 counties that have enacted bans on renewable power projects would become open for development.  The measure is opposed by the Association of Indiana Counties and the Indiana Association of County Commissioners. They expressed concerns about impeding local control. Farmers and private homeowners have also spoken against the bill with concerns about loss of agricultural land and possible safety risks associated with large wind turbines.  The Hoosier Environmental Council said it worries that statewide standards could make it impossible for local governments to mandate pollinator-friendly plants be planted below solar installations.  Democrats and advocacy groups are also raising concerns about House Bill 1191, which would take away local governments’ ability to prohibit natural gas hookups for home heating in new construction.  Authored by Republican Rep. Jim Pressel, the bill would also restrict state universities from choosing how they acquire power sources, including carbon-friendly energy sources for buildings or vehicle fleets.  “I think it’s very unfair to our constituents, any of them, to take away any source of energy that is currently, during a pandemic, the cheapest and most affordable way to heat your house,” Pressel said. “So, do we want local units of government potentially, and I stress potentially, to take that away from them when things could be so bad for them now?”  Criticizing the electrification bill that has advanced to the Senate, Democratic Rep. Matt Pierce said it was “searching for a problem to solve,” noting that it creates bureaucracy and higher costs for local governments and state-funded universities to pursue sustainable energy initiatives.","Indiana lawmakers debate environmental regulation, rollbacks"

The Jan. 27 order instructed federal agencies to suspend oil and gas leasing until the leasing program is reviewed. In separate orders Friday, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the Bureau of Land Management postponed lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and four Western states: Colorado, Montana, Utah and Wyoming. The onshore sales were postponed to confirm the adequacy of underlying environmental analyses, said Interior spokesperson Melissa Schwartz.  Low interest and small attendance at offshore lease sales covering different parts of the Gulf of Mexico prompted President Barack Obama’s administration to combine them. Gulf-wide sales began in 2017. Those also have received sparse responses, with some attracting bidders for less than 1% of the available tracts.  “We remain hopeful that the administration will proceed with the (offshore) lease sale upon completion of its review,” said Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association.

The Senate version of the bill, which was jointly referred to the Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee and the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, is being sponsored by Sen. Chris West, R-Baltimore County.  The Value My Vote Act, SB0224, was heard in the Senate Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee last week.  The legislation has bipartisan support through its cross-filed House bill, HB0222, sponsored by Del. Jheanelle K. Wilkins, D-Montgomery. Both Wilkins and West spoke at a press conference last week hosted by the various voting rights advocacy groups in support of this bill, including Common Cause, Out for Justice, Life After Release and Schools not Jails.  If passed, this bill would require the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services to provide a voter registration application as well as documentation informing the individual that their voting rights have been restored to incarcerated felons upon their release.  The department would also be required to post signage in every parole and probation office, as well as on their website, indicating that incarcerated felons are reinstated their voting rights upon release.  The voting rights of convicted felons were restored in Maryland — one of 14 states that allow former felons to vote — after a change to election law in 2016.  But the state needs to do more to inform inmates of their voting rights, according to the advocacy groups that gave testimony at the SB0224 bill hearing.  Mckayla Wilkes, the co-founder and executive director of School Not Jails, a non-profit organization that aims to end the school-to-prison pipeline, testified during the hearing that she canvassed several jails and was surprised to learn that a number of felons being released did not know they had voting rights again.  Wilkes stated that this bill would be a step in the right direction to improve voter education.  “We are not restoring any rights, but we are allowing people to exercise their right to vote,” Wilkes said in her testimony.  Another requirement of this bill is that it would provide voter registration applications and informational materials to individuals who are currently incarcerated, but have not been convicted of a felony. This would include people who are being held awaiting a trial or have been charged with a misdemeanor crime, both of which do not disqualify a person from voting.  The Value My Vote Act would require the State Board of Elections or a local election board to establish a program to give out these materials at least 30 days before an election.  The Board of Elections would also be required to provide instructions on absentee voting and absentee ballot applications, as well as provide numerous opportunities for voters to register, according to a state legislative analysis.  Currently, there are approximately 9,000 people in the state of Maryland who are being held awaiting trial, and approximately 15,000 who are in jail due to misdemeanor crimes, according to West.  Dana Paikowsky, a voting rights lawyer for Equal Justice Works who testified at the Senate bill hearing, stated that it can be very difficult for eligible voters who are incarcerated to exercise their voting rights, as they do not have access to election or candidate information, as well as basic things like stamps or writing utensils.  Paikowsky also stated that the groups most likely to be affected by this “jail-based disenfranchisement” are people of color, low-income individuals, and people with disabilities.  These factors are also the No. 1 predictors of whether someone is likely to vote, according to Paikowsky.  “By creating a program like this one, the state is trying to counteract that failure of democracy and engage a cross-section of voters that have been historically and consistently marginalized,” Paikowsky said in her testimony.  “This proposed legislation has been battle-tested,” Nicole Hanson-Mundell, executive director of Out for Justice, an organization that advocates for criminal justice reform, said in an interview with Capital News Service.  Out for Justice worked with the state Board of Elections and created voting information packets to be distributed to local detention facilities across the state, and also went inside the Howard County Detention Center to register voters.  The organization also spoke with recently released felons.  “I think we engaged almost 1,000 people just in the short window between the primary and the general election,” Hanson-Mundell said.  If this bill passes, the State Board of Elections would also be required to file a report each year by Jan. 15 to the Senate Education, Health and Environmental Affairs as well as the House Ways and Means committees.  This report would have information about the number of eligible voters who registered and voted successfully through an absentee ballot.  The report would also need to document how many times the State Board of Elections visited each correctional facility, how long their visit was, and a description of what they did, according to the legislative analysis.  During the bill hearing, there was no opposing testimony heard.  The implementation of this program would cost $358,833 annually, to be split between the state and local governments, according to the fiscal note. Funds would pay for trained correctional officers to provide information and voting applications at about 60 facilities, and to report their activities.

The pharmaceuticals, microplastics and synthetic chemicals are known collectively as PFAS and are used in a variety of consumer products because of their durability and resistance to heat and water. An increasing number of scientists have linked some PFAS to negative health effects in humans, such as low birth weight, thyroid and kidney problems and some cancers.  “These forever chemicals are everywhere,” Minnesota Pollution Control Agency Commissioner Laura Bishop said in a Zoom meeting that included leaders from other state agencies, lawmakers and environmental activists. “And new PFAS are being invented, used in industry and incorporated into commercial products, and released into the environment every day.” The Minnesota PFAS Blueprint calls for the state to enact stronger regulations, including designating more than 5,000 different chemicals as hazardous substances under Minnesota’s Superfund law. That would make it easier to hold companies financially liable for cleaning up PFAS pollution.  The plan also calls for additional $3 million in state funding over the next two years to help researchers identify sources of PFAS in the environment and find out how the chemicals are coming into landfills, compost sites and wastewater treatment plants and ending up in Minnesota’s waters.

John Bel Edwards disagrees with President Joe Biden’s targeting of fossil fuel industries and wants the White House to reconsider its decision to pause new oil and gas drilling leases in the Gulf of Mexico, the Louisiana governor’s administration said Wednesday.  Biden’s approach to oil and gas strikes at one of Louisiana’s economic engines and an industry that is a chief financial backer of the state’s coastal restoration work, putting the Democratic governor at odds with a president within his own party.  ADVERTISEMENT  The governor’s top lawyer, coastal adviser and natural resources secretary told state lawmakers that Edwards thinks Biden’s moratorium on new oil and gas drilling leases on federal land and waters is the wrong approach to combat climate change.  Environmental groups have lauded Biden’s approach, arguing that it is the kind of bold, urgent action needed to slow climate change, which has been linked to droughts, devastating wildfires and a rising number of hurricanes that have pummeled the region.  Edwards this week, however, voiced concerns about the moratorium to Biden’s energy secretary pick, Jennifer Granholm, according to Louisiana Natural Resources Secretary Thomas Harris.  “I know he’s arguing. He’s working it every day. He’s constantly calling me looking for new ammunition” to make his case to the Biden administration, Harris said.  But lawmakers on the state House and Senate natural resources committees pushed Edwards to make a direct appeal to Biden, noting that as the only Democratic governor in the Deep South he could have more sway with the president.  “We’ve got to do something, talk to somebody and make some moves,” said Sen. Mike Fesi, a Houma Republican who owns an oil and gas pipeline construction and maintenance company.  While the Edwards administration talked of trying to negotiate with the White House, Republican Attorney General Jeff Landry intends more direct challenges to the Biden administration’s regulatory and executive actions.  “In cases where we can, we will litigate,” said Bill Stiles, Landry’s chief deputy.  States have little control or say in the management of federal lands and waters, however, leaving political pressure, appeals to Congress and suggestions for alternate policies among their options to reverse Biden’s policies. Edwards has regularly refused to air his grievances with presidents, Republican or Democrat, publicly. Harris said the governor will continue that approach in this disagreement with the Biden administration.  “I think the best thing we can do is make the coherent argument that what they’re proposing is not the appropriate path forward,” Harris said.  Biden wants to shift the nation’s focus from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives, such as wind and solar energy, with a goal of eliminating pollution from fossil fuel in the power sector by 2035 and from the U.S. economy overall by 2050. The president suggests his directives will create jobs in renewable energy and other sectors that can offset the lost employment in oil and natural gas.  But Louisiana officials and industry representatives say Biden’s actions will cause massive job losses across the Gulf Coast, crater economic activity in the region and strip millions of dollars that Louisiana uses from offshore drilling to pay for coastal restoration projects.  Wednesday’s hearing at the Louisiana Capitol outlined those fears, with Republican members of the state’s congressional delegation, leaders of coastal parishes and oil and gas representatives predicting widespread damaging impacts.  “The Biden administration wasted no time launching a full scale assault on oil and gas that will send production overseas and further injure the economy,” said Republican U.S. Rep. Clay Higgins.  Oil and gas extracted from public lands and waters account for about a quarter of annual U.S. production. Extracting and burning those fuels generates the equivalent of almost 550 million tons (500 metric tons) of greenhouse gases annually, the U.S. Geological Survey said in a 2018 study.  Leading a state where tens of thousands of jobs are tied to fossil fuels, Edwards has argued the oil and gas industry should be involved in technological improvements and energy advancements that curtail greenhouse gas emissions and lessen the impacts of climate change.","Louisiana governor at odds with Biden over oil, gas policy"

The report comes as wildfire risks intensify across the drought-stricken U.S. West. Climatologists and environmentalists have been warning about worsening conditions across the region, particularly in New Mexico, which is home to Los Alamos National Laboratory and where summer rains failed to materialize last year and winter precipitation has been spotty at best. The birthplace of the atomic bomb, Los Alamos has experienced hundreds of millions of dollars in losses and damage from major wildfires over the last two decades. That includes a blaze in 2000 that forced the lab to close for about two weeks, ruined scientific projects, destroyed a portion of the town and threatened tens of thousands of barrels of radioactive waste stored on lab property.  Watchdog groups say the federal government needs to take note of the latest findings and conduct a comprehensive review before the lab ramps up production of key plutonium parts used in the nation’s nuclear arsenal.  “The threat and risks of wildfire to the lab and northern New Mexico will continue to increase because of climate warming, drought and expanded nuclear weapons production,” said Jay Coghlan, director of the group Nuclear Watch New Mexico.  The audit released this month found that cutting back vegetation along power lines and other measures to reduce the risk of catastrophic fires were not always done, increasing the potential for another devastating fire like the Cerro Grande Fire in 2000.  Federal auditors said not all fire roads were maintained to ensure safe passage for firefighters and equipment responding to blazes on lab property.  The audit also cited federal policy that requires a comprehensive, risk-based approach to wildfire management — something the inspector general’s office said had not been developed by the contractor that manages the lab for the U.S. government. It also pointed to a lack of oversight by Energy Department field staff.  “Without documenting planning and preparedness activities, there was no assurance that all prevention and mitigation options were considered and that the site was fully prepared for wildland fire events,” the audit says. The report included photos that depicted overgrown areas. In Los Alamos Canyon, for example, specialists indicated there were about 400 to 500 trees per acre. Auditors said the ideal number should be 40 to 50 trees per acre.  Lab spokesman Peter Alden Hyde said that since the audit was conducted in late 2018 and early 2019, the lab has adopted “an aggressive approach” to wildfire management on its 39-square-mile (101-square-kilometer) campus. That has included thinning vegetation along access routes, improving fire roads and recently removing thousands of trees downed by wind storms.  “We continue to review our wildfire and forest health plans and have already implemented most of the recommendations the Department of Energy offered to improve our efforts to protect the public, the environment and the laboratory,” he said.  It was not immediately clear how many acres were thinned during the last year or whether the lab had any major projects planned for 2021.",Audit raises concerns about wildfire risks at US nuclear lab

The commerce giant said in a statement that it put “processes in place” to “proactively block” unregistered pesticides and products making inaccurate claims about COVID-19 before they are listed for sale.  “We have no idea what those products are made of,” Chad Schulze, an EPA enforcement officer in Seattle, said Tuesday. “And when you have people purchasing a product that says it will kill or control viruses in their personal space but it does not, that’s a huge risk as well.”  The EPA previously claimed Amazon committed about 4,000 violations of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act between 2013 and 2018 by allowing third-party vendors to sell and distribute products not evaluated by the agency.  Amazon settled those charges for $1.2 million and committed to more closely monitoring and removing illegal pesticides from its marketplace.

Workers installed the first of 829 steel poles Tuesday on a widened portion of the existing corridor that is part of the project near The Forks, as the groundwork is laid for the 145-mile (230-kilometer) New England Clean Energy Connect.  The work is getting started even though the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals delayed construction of a new 53-mile (85-kilometer) section. Three conservation groups are seeking an injunction to delay the project while they sue to force the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a more rigorous environmental review.  In western Maine, workers already have staged heavy equipment and timber “mats” that will be used to prevent the equipment from damaging the ground. About 275 Maine workers already have been hired, and more would be hired if not for the litigation, officials said.  “This project has always promised to provide an economic boost to Maine’s economy, and we are already seeing those benefits take shape,” Thorn Dickinson, CEO of the New England Clean Energy Connect, said Tuesday.  The electricity transmission line would provide a conduit for up to 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower, reducing greenhouse emissions and stabilizing energy costs in New England, supporters say.  The project, which would be fully funded by Massachusetts ratepayers to meet the state’s clean energy goals, calls for construction of a high-voltage power line from Mount Beattie Township on the Canadian border to the regional power grid in Lewiston, Maine.  Critics have been trying to stop the project, saying it would destroy wilderness in western Maine. They also say that the environmental benefits of the project have been overstated.  In addition to the lawsuit, opponents have submitted petitions seeking to have a statewide vote.  Sandi Howard, a leading opponent of the project, said the decision by the company to proceed showed “disdain for everyday Mainers” by ignoring permit appeals and ongoing litigation.  “For years, CMP has pushed the false narrative that their unpopular and destructive project is a ‘done deal’ to bully Mainers into submission on this for-profit project. But to be clear, we won’t stop until Maine voters (their customers), have the chance to vote,” said Howard, who led the referendum petition drive for the No CMP Corridor PAC.  The project has received permits from the Army Corps, Maine Department of Environmental Protection, Maine Land Use Planning Commission and Maine Public Utilities Commission.

The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee advanced Regan’s nomination Tuesday on a 14-6 vote. Four Republicans, including new committee member Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, joined with all 10 Democrats to support Regan.  Regan, who has served as North Carolina’s top environmental regulator since 2017, would be the first Black man to run the EPA. Lisa Jackson, EPA administrator in President Barack Obama’s first term, was the first African American to lead the agency.  Regan is known in his home state for pursuing cleanups of industrial toxins and helping low-income and minority communities significantly affected by pollution. Sen.

Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm was endorsed as energy secretary last week.  A third Biden nominee, Deb Haaland, has not yet had a hearing on her selection to lead the Interior Department. Two Republican senators, Steve Daines of Montana and John Barrasso of Wyoming, have announced they will oppose Haaland, a New Mexico congresswoman. Both lawmakers cite concerns over Biden’s decision to impose a moratorium on new oil and gas leases on federal lands, and his rejection of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada.  Daines said in a statement he will seek to block Haaland’s nomination on the Senate floor. “I’m deeply concerned with the congresswoman’s support on several radical issues that will hurt Montana, our way of life, our jobs and rural America, including her support for the Green New Deal and President Biden’s oil and gas moratorium, as well as her opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline,″ Daines said.  He also was concerned by Haaland’s responses on issues such as wildlife management and access by hunters and sportsmen to public lands, Daines said.  Barrasso, the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement that Haaland’s “radical views are squarely at odds with the responsible management of our nation’s energy resources.″ Citing her opposition to oil and gas production on federal lands, Barrasso said Haaland “must demonstrate that she will follow the law, protect the multiple uses of our public lands and reject policies that will force energy workers into the unemployment line.″  Haaland, who was elected to her second term in November, is a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe. Her selection has been hailed by Democrats, environmentalists and tribal groups as a historic pick that would make her the first Native American to lead the powerful federal agency that has wielded influence over the nation’s tribes for generations.  The Biden administration has put racial equity, climate change and health at the forefront of its agenda, and Haaland’s selection “fortifies this commitment,″ said Marissa Ramirez of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. “She represents the promise of a new era for this country’s connection with its land, especially those often excluded.″  Sen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat who serves on the energy panel, said he is optimistic Haaland will reorient Interior toward “forward-thinking objectives” such as outdoor recreation, climate solutions, wildlife preservation, clean water and rural economic development.  “I am eager to support her confirmation so she can get to work protecting our natural heritage for future generations,″ Heinrich said.  A spokesman for the Interior Department said the “targeted pause” on new oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters does not affect existing operations or permits for existing leases, “which are continuing to be reviewed and approved.” The order does not restrict energy development on private, state or tribal lands.

Dozens of owners along Hawaii beaches have used loopholes in environmental laws to leave emergency measures in place for extended periods to protect homes, hotels and condominiums, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Sunday.  Under proposed legislation in the current session, owners would face strict deadlines for removing protections and increased penalties for installing them without permission.   House and Senate bills set a hard deadline of three years for removing current and newly authorized emergency protections.  A bill introduced by Democratic Sen. Chris Lee increases fines for homeowners and contractors who install structures without state permission.  Owners and builders could both be fined up to $25,000 for each day that an illegal structure remains on the public shoreline, up from the current maximum fine of $15,000.  Lee said his bill clarifies that temporary fixes property owners have enjoyed are not going to become long-term solutions that cause permanent damage.  Losing beaches to erosion “will have a devastating impact on the local economy, on local businesses, on jobs, on people who live in those communities, to say nothing of the families who will lose that beach for their kids,” Lee said.  Property owners can legally only keep emergency protections in place temporarily.  But the state Department of Land and Natural Resources has used liberal interpretations of the timeframe, allowing sandbag walls to remain in front of properties for years after issuing repeated approvals or losing track of them.  Coastal scientists warn the protective structures can be just as damaging to beaches as seawalls, which have contributed to the loss of about a quarter of the beaches on Oahu, Maui and Kauai.  Waves hitting an armored shoreline pull sand from the beach. Sandbags also have blocked public shorelines, created eyesores and littered beaches with heavy fabric and rope torn and whipped about by waves.  Property owners on Oahu’s North Shore have taken some of the most dramatic steps by installing so-called burritos constructed of heavy, black material anchored by sand-filled tubes to protect homes from being pulled into the ocean.  Kelly Slater, 11-time world surfing champion, installed the protections without first obtaining state permission and paid a $2,000 fine.

Ice sheets surged across North America, Australasia and the Andes. Wind belts shifted across the Pacific and Southern Oceans. Prolonged drought hit Australia; that continent’s biggest mammals went extinct. Humans took to caves to make ochre-color art. Neanderthals died off for good. Through it all, one giant kauri tree stood tall — until, after nearly two millenniums, it died and fell in a swamp, where the chemical records embedded in its flesh were immaculately preserved. That tree, unearthed a few years ago near Ngawha Springs in northern New Zealand, finally allowed researchers to fit a tight timeline to what before had seemed like an intriguing but only vaguely correlated series of events. What if, the researchers posited, the crash of the magnetic field spawned the climatic changes of that era?

The fish are not yet orange, striped or even capable of swimming. They are still plankton, a term that comes from the Greek word for “wanderer,” and wander they do, drifting at the mercy of the currents in an oceanic rumspringa. When the baby clown fish grow big enough to swim against the tide, they high-tail it home. The fish can’t see the reef, but they can hear its snapping, grunting, gurgling, popping and croaking. These noises make up the soundscape of a healthy reef, and larval fish rely on these soundscapes to find their way back to the reefs, where they will spend the rest of their lives — that is, if they can hear them. But humans — and their ships, seismic surveys, air guns, pile drivers, dynamite fishing, drilling platforms, speedboats and even surfing — have made the ocean an unbearably noisy place for marine life, according to a sweeping review of the prevalence and intensity of the impacts of anthropogenic ocean noise published on Thursday in the journal Science. The paper, a collaboration among 25 authors from across the globe and various fields of marine acoustics, is the largest synthesis of evidence on the effects of oceanic noise pollution. “They hit the nail on the head,” said Kerri Seger, a senior scientist at Applied Ocean Sciences who was not involved with the research. “By the third page, I was like, ‘I’m going to send this to my students.’”","In the Oceans, the Volume Is Rising as Never Before"

One such critter was Apomys sacobianus, the Pinatubo volcano mouse, which spent its days hunting for earthworms and other foods. On June 15, 1991, the apocalypse befell paradise. Molten rock exploded from the volcano, smothering most of its flanks in superheated, thundering avalanches of toxic gas and debris that instantly exterminated all life in its wake. Almost 1,000 feet was shorn off its summit, leaving behind a 1.5-mile hole and obliterating the surrounding forest.

Exxon Mobil, BP and other large oil companies collectively lost tens of billions of dollars last year, posting their worst performance in years and, for some companies, in decades. The pandemic was largely to blame. It sapped demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel as countries and states locked down and people stayed home. But such painful years could become more commonplace as growing concerns about climate change, tighter regulations, and the rise of electric cars and trucks force a reckoning for an industry that has dominated the global economy over much of the last century. General Motors further raised the stakes for the industry last week when it said it aimed to do away with internal combustion engines and sell only electric cars by 2035. The oil industry is slowly transitioning to a future dominated by cleaner energy. BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and other European companies are investing considerable resources in offshore wind and solar energy while cutting back on oil. But those investments are unlikely to pay off for years, maybe even a decade or two.

Oceanic sharks and rays have declined by 71 percent since 1970, mainly because of overfishing. The collapse is probably even more stark, the authors point out, because of incomplete data from some of the worst-hit regions and because fishing fleets were already expanding in the decades before they started their analysis. “There is a very small window to save these iconic creatures,” said Nathan Pacoureau, a marine biologist at Simon Fraser University in Canada and the study’s lead author. More than three quarters of oceanic shark and ray species are now threatened with extinction, jeopardizing marine ecosystems and the food security of people in many nations. The research offers the latest data point in what is a dismal trajectory for Earth’s biodiversity.

Mr. Biden said his directives would reserve 30 percent of federal land and water for conservation purposes, make climate policy central to national security decisions and build out a network of electric-car charging stations nationwide. But much of the sales pitch on employment looked intended to counteract longstanding Republican attacks that Mr. Biden’s climate policies would inevitably hurt an economy already weakened by the pandemic. Mr. Biden argued instead that technological gains and demands for wind and solar infrastructure would create work that would more than make up for job losses even in parts of the country reliant on the fracking boom.

But as global warming accelerates and society continues to emit greenhouse gases at a dangerous rate, the idea is gaining support from a surprising source: large companies facing pressure to act on climate. A growing number of corporations are pouring money into so-called engineered carbon removal — for example, using giant fans to pull carbon dioxide from the air and trap it. The companies say these techniques, by offsetting emissions they can’t otherwise cut, may be the only way to fulfill lofty “net zero” pledges. Occidental Petroleum and United Airlines are investing in a large “direct air capture” plant in Texas that will use fans and chemical agents to scrub carbon dioxide from the sky and inject it underground. Stripe and Shopify, two e-commerce companies, have each begun spending at least $1 million per year on start-ups working on carbon removal techniques, such as sequestering the gas in concrete for buildings.

188,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/climate/2020-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html,NYT,Towards Left,"WASHINGTON — America’s greenhouse gas emissions from energy and industry plummeted more than 10 percent in 2020, reaching their lowest levels in at least three decades as the coronavirus pandemic slammed the brakes on the nation’s economy, according to an estimate published Tuesday by the Rhodium Group. The steep drop, however, was the result of extraordinary circumstances and experts warned that the country still faced enormous challenges in getting its planet-warming pollution under control. In the years ahead, United States emissions are widely expected to bounce back once the pandemic recedes and the economy rumbles back to life — unless policymakers take stronger action to clean up the country’s power plants, factories, cars and trucks. “The most significant reductions last year were around transportation, which remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels,” said Kate Larsen, a director at Rhodium Group, a research and consulting firm. “But as vaccines become more prevalent, and depending on how quickly people feel comfortable enough to drive and fly again, we’d expect emissions to rebound unless there are major policy changes put in place.” Before the pandemic hit, America’s emissions had been slowly but steadily declining since 2005, in large part because utilities that generate electricity have been shifting away from coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, in favor of cheaper and cleaner natural gas, wind and solar power. Over the past decade, utilities have retired hundreds of coal-burning power plants despite President Trump’s efforts to revive the industry.",Covid-19 Took a Bite From U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions in 2020

191,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/02/23/deb-haaland-interior-secretary-hearing/,WP,Towards Left,"The Senate confirmation hearing for Deb Haaland, nominated to become the first Native American interior secretary, morphed Tuesday into a proxy fight over the future of fossil fuels as lawmakers from oil- and gas-producing states grilled her regarding the Biden administration’s embrace of green energy. Nearly all the Republican members of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee questioned Haaland about her past statements regarding the need to stop drilling on federal lands managed by the Interior Department. President Biden, who says the country needs to transition away from burning fossil fuels to mitigate climate change, has paused new drilling leases on public lands and waters — a sharp departure from the Trump administration, which worked to expand drilling. Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the top Republican on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, asked in rapid succession if the federal government should permit new gas wells and coal leases in states that rely heavily on them. “The state of Wyoming has collected over a billion dollars annually in royalties and taxes from oil, gas and coal produced on federal lands within our borders, within our borders and Wyoming isn’t the only state that benefits from energy production on public lands,” he said. “We shouldn’t undermine America’s energy production and we should not hurt our own economy. Yet that’s precisely what the Biden administration is doing by signing an executive order to ban all new oil, coal, gas leases on federal lands, the president is taking a sledgehammer to Western states’ economies.” Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) flagged the executive order Biden signed on his first day in office that placed a temporary moratorium on oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). “You’ve got to understand, [Alaskans are] looking at this and saying, ‘Wait a minute, why is this administration out to get us?’ ” Murkowski told Haaland. “I don’t think they’re out to get us, but I do think that there is a definite threat to the resource industry that our state is blessed to be able to host.” And Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) said Haaland’s views “are frankly alarming” to her constituents, and asked what she would say to people who could lose jobs if oil production in the Gulf of Mexico was limited. Through it all, Haaland — who would also become the first Native American Cabinet secretary if confirmed — remained calm, stressed that she wanted to work with supporters and opponents alike, and kept her answers short. Haaland, 60, sought to defuse aggressive questions from Republicans by reminding them that she was named the most bipartisan freshman congresswoman during her first term in the House as a Democrat from New Mexico, a seat to which she was reelected in November. And she repeatedly stressed that any changes to fossil fuel production would be Biden’s decision, saying her role if confirmed would be to execute his policy. “I couldn’t agree more that collaboration is important,” Haaland said during the more than two-hour-long hearing, which adjourned at noon and is scheduled to continue at 10 a.m. Wednesday. “I was the highest-rated freshman in Congress on bipartisan collaboration. We can have different views. We can think differently. I feel like the people of New Mexico sent me to Congress to get work done and that’s exactly what I’ve done.” On the question of oil and gas leases, Haaland said Biden paused new leases to review them and that it did not amount to a ban. At any rate, she added, leasing permits currently under review are going forward. Haaland also emphasized that although she and the president support solar, wind and other clean energy to decrease the greenhouse gas emissions that are heating the planet, the transition to renewables would be slowly phased in as fossil fuels continue to dominate the American energy agenda. Interior oversees nearly 500 million acres of surface land and almost 700 million acres of resources that lay beneath it. On top of that, it manages 2.5 billion acres on the outer continental shelf, about 50 million acres of Native American land held in trusts, more than 400 national parks, 500 wildlife refuges and a water supply for 31 million people. The value of that and more generates $12 billion for treasury, $315 billion to the U.S. economy and nearly 2 million jobs, said Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), the committee chairman. Although nearly every Republican on the committee appeared either hostile or cool to Haaland’s bid to lead Interior, only Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) said outright that he would vote against her nomination. Haaland was not without Republican supporters — they just weren’t in the Senate. Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska) introduced Haaland to the panel and lavished her with praise. Young called Haaland a friend who reached across the aisle to work with him on the House Natural Resources Committee. “It’s my job to try to convince her she’s not all right and it’s her job to convince me she’s … right,” he said. Biden has a right to choose his own Cabinet, he added. “I’m supporting her because she’s American Indian. As you mentioned, it’s a long time overdue.” Haaland repeatedly said she would “work my heart out” to make sure that American workers are able to transition to good paying, green energy jobs. “I’m not a stranger to the struggles many families across America face today — I’ve lived most of my adult life paycheck to paycheck,” said Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna. She spoke about the labor that will be in demand to restore the land disrupted by mining, cap old wells leaking methane, and repair and upgrade national parks. The stark difference between Haaland and her immediate predecessor, David Bernhardt, a onetime oil industry lobbyist tapped by President Donald Trump, showed when Manchin asked Haaland a perfunctory question after swearing her in to testify. “Do you hold any funds in a blind trust?” “No,” replied Haaland, a single mother who at times has relied on food stamps.

192,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/02/23/climate-change-natural-gas/,WP,Towards Left,"A new front has opened in the battle over climate change: The kitchen. Cities and towns across the country are rewriting local building codes so that new homes and offices would be blocked from using natural gas, a fossil fuel that when burned emits carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. New laws would force builders to install heat pumps instead of gas furnaces and electric kitchen stoves instead of gas burners. Local leaders say reducing the carbon and methane pollution associated with buildings, the source of 12.3 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, is the only way they can meet their 2050 zero-emission goals to curb climate change. But the American Gas Association, a trade group, and its members are campaigning in statehouses across the country to prohibit the new local ordinances. Four states last year adopted such laws, and this year similar legislation has been introduced in 12 more. “Logically the natural gas industry does not want to see its business end, so it’s doing what it can to keep natural gas in the utility grid mix,” said Marta Schantz, senior vice president of the Urban Land Institute’s Greenprint Center for Building Performance. “But long term, if cities are serious about their climate goals, electric buildings are inevitable.” The issue started heating up in July 2019, when Berkeley, Calif., became the first city in the nation to ban natural gas hookups in new construction or substantially renovated structures. Natural gas is marketed as the “clean” fossil fuel because when burned it produces about 30 percent less carbon dioxide than oil and 45 percent less than coal. The ordinance passed unanimously. Since then, municipalities across the country have followed suit. In California alone, 42 municipalities, including San Francisco, changed their building codes to make natural gas use impossible or difficult. In Colorado, Denver’s Office of Climate Action, Sustainability and Resiliency endorsed a plan that calls for newly built homes and buildings to be mostly electrified by 2027. And Boulder changed its building code and imposed a maximum energy use per square foot on new residential construction of 3,000 square feet or larger, effectively leaving little room for gas. The state of Washington also is at the forefront of this campaign. Gov. Jay Inslee (D) has backed a bill that would phase out the gas utility service and give local governments the authority to set more stringent energy standards than the state code. On Feb. 1, the Seattle City Council voted unanimously to restrict natural gas use in new commercial buildings and multifamily homes higher than three stories. Puget Sound Energy, which distributes both gas and electricity to Washington customers, says it is “fuel neutral” and set an “aspirational goal” of being carbon neutral for its gas sales by 2045. Mary E. Kipp, the firm’s chief executive, said that “climate change is an existential threat that cannot be ignored.” Most of the gas industry, however, is fighting back. Southern California Gas, one of the biggest distributors in the country, set up a group called Californians for Balanced Energy Solutions with a website that makes no mention of the gas company or the group’s industry links. In the Pacific Northwest, a group of gas and pipeline companies put up $1 million to establish another front group called Partnership for Energy Progress. The group’s website lists other backers, including pipe fitters and steelworkers unions, farmers and energy- intensive businesses. “Natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel and provides reliable and affordable energy whenever it’s needed,” it says. The AGA says it doesn’t engage in lobbying at the local or state levels, but it has provided its members with myriad supportive documents, which say that electricity and construction costs will increase in the new building requirements. So far, laws to protect natural gas use have been adopted in Arizona, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Tennessee. Similar laws have been proposed in Texas, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Utah, Indiana, Arkansas, Kentucky and Mississippi. Even in the states where the anti-natural gas movement is strongest, municipal efforts have run into obstacles. In November 2019, the California Restaurant Association sued the town of Berkeley to strike down the change in building code. The association in its lawsuit said that “many of these restaurants rely on gas for cooking particular types of food, whether it be flame-seared meats, charred vegetables, or the use of intense heat from a flame under a wok.” It added that “a patchwork approach [to natural gas] is unworkable, undercuts California’s need for reliable and resilient energy, increases the cost of housing, and denies consumers choice.” “The average American likes choice and doesn’t want to be told what kind of fuel to use in their homes,” said Karen Harbert, chief executive of the American Gas Association. “Municipalities cannot take away that choice.” “The natural gas industry frames it as a choice issue; we frame it as a choice issue,” said Johanna Neumann, a senior director at Environment America, an environmental group. “The industry frames it as a choice for people who want to use natural gas. We see it as a choice for a community to decide its energy future.” Natural gas has long been marketed as the clean-burning fuel. “Gas. The wonder fuel for cooking,” says a postwar AGA ad showing a slim, happy couple. “Perform new cooking miracles yourself on a modern gas range,” says another from 1939 showing an apron-clad mother feeding a child in a high chair. “Quickest heat, highest heat, steadiest heat. You get them all — only with gas — the most responsive fuel.” But views of natural gas have changed. Consumers can now buy improved heat pumps and induction stoves, which can boil water in nearly half the time as a gas stove. Induction stoves also have no open flame and leave behind little residual heat once they’re turned off. But they account for only about 5 percent of new stove sales, according to Consumer Reports. Moreover, natural gas emissions still make a large contribution to the world’s greenhouse gases. Total residential and commercial greenhouse gas emissions increased by 9 percent from 1990 to 2018. In addition to emphasizing climate considerations, many environmental groups have been arguing that gas stoves and heaters create indoor air pollution, especially nitrogen dioxide. “The indoor air quality analysis found that concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) during cooking events can exceed the levels set by national and California-based ambient air quality standards,” said a study by the University of California at Los Angeles. The study was commissioned by the Sierra Club. UCLA Fielding School of Public Health Professor Yifang Zhu, the lead researcher, said that “fossil fuel use in household appliances can adversely impact indoor air quality and public health.” Burning natural gas also creates equity issues, as low-income homes tend to be smaller with kitchen stoves that are less well ventilated. But natural gas is cheaper than electricity in most parts of the United States, at least for now. Forty-seven percent of U.S. homes rely on natural gas for heat while 36 percent rely on electricity, according to the EIA. “Right now there is a significant upfront cost to the transition to different appliances. There are real switching costs. That’s important for us to be honest about,” said Eileen Quigley, executive director of the Seattle-based Clean Energy Transition Institute. “That doesn’t mean we don’t make the transition. It means we have to address them. The challenge of decarbonization is upfront cost now and the payback that we’ll get later.” In some places, local governments make allowances for special businesses such as restaurants. “People say okay, we’ll let you alone if you’re a restaurant and have gas stoves. That kind of carve-out is crazy from a technical point of view, but not politically,” said Sue Tierney, senior adviser of the consulting firm Analysis Group and a former utility regulator in Massachusetts. And local leaders emphasize that owners of existing kitchen stoves, boilers and water heaters do not need to change anything. “This rule applies only to new buildings — so for those of you who love your gas stove so much that Berkeley would have to pry it out of your cold dead hands, you won’t have to let go of your gas-burning appliances quite yet,” a Union of Concerned Scientists blog said. The Massachusetts town of Brookline sought a compromise with its code change. It said new buildings had to install electric boilers but they could still use gas stoves. Massachusetts state Rep. Tommy Vitolo (D), a lawmaker who also does mathematical analyses of electric power markets for the consulting firm Synapse Energy Economics, said there were two good reasons, one political and one scientific. “The science is the amount of combustion you do at your oven is minuscule compared to the damage done by a water or space heater. It’s a tiny, tiny fraction. It’s small ball,” he said. The political one is that “people really like their cooktops. There is something intimate and ritualistic about it. So let’s go after the things that are big and that people don’t have strong attachments to.” Vitolo lives in a 106-year-old house that still has a gas stove and gas clothes dryer. “So our gas usage is very small, but it’s not zero.” Brookline’s policy carve-out, however, wasn’t enough to avoid a clash with someone who is ordinarily an ally of climate experts and activists. In July 2020 Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) — a leader of efforts to hold ExxonMobil responsible for hiding knowledge it allegedly had about how burning fossil fuels would lead to climate change — threw out the town’s new building code because she said it encroached on state authority. “The Attorney General agrees with the policy goals behind the Town’s attempt to reduce the use of fossil fuels within the Town,” Healey wrote. However, she added, “the Town cannot add an additional layer of regulation” to state codes. “This is true no matter how well-intentioned the Town’s action, and no matter how strong the Town’s belief that its favored option best serves the public health of its residents.” Now, the Massachusetts legislature is trying to change state law to allow a state agency to draft a net-zero building code that municipalities could choose to adopt. There would not be a patchwork of codes — just two options, according to state guidelines. The governor has been reluctant to sign it. Talks are in progress. Vitolo says the costs of delay are great. “If we install a furnace or burner in a building in 2022, will we have to take it out before the end of its useful life in order to meet emissions targets?” he asked. That’s the important comparison, he said: not gas vs. electric now, but gas now plus heat pumps 15 years later. Brookline is already requiring the changes in its municipal buildings. “Whatever we’re going to build as a town, we are the ones who will be responsible,” Vitolo said. “We don’t want the town meeting in 2040 to say, ‘Those guys in 2020 did a terrible job.’ ”",The battle over climate change is boiling over on the home front 
193,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/02/18/energy-202-democrats-eye-climate-big-infrastructure-push/,WP,Towards Left,"with Alexandra Ellerbeck President Biden and congressional Democrats are already bracing for the next big legislative fight — a major infrastructure package that may aim to bolster clean energy. But a cacophony of competing demands is already threatening to divide Democrats who have largely united behind the coronavirus relief bill currently being debated in Congress.  As Erica Werner, Jeff Stein and I report, Biden met Wednesday with senior leadership of the AFL-CIO and other labor unions at the White House and discussed both the current relief package and the coming infrastructure push. “We are so far behind the curve. We rank like 38th in the world in terms of infrastructure, everything from canals to highways to airports, to everything we can do and we need to do to make ourselves competitive in the 21st Century,” Biden said as the Oval Office meeting got underway. The calls for boosting spending on infrastructure comes as the power system in Texas reels from a winter storm that has left more than 500,000 customers without electricity as of Thursday morning. Senior Democratic officials have discussed proposing as much as $3 trillion in new spending as part of a wide-ranging jobs and infrastructure package that would be the foundation of Biden’s “Build Back Better” program, according to three people granted anonymity to share details of private deliberations.  Unlike under former president Donald Trump, whose many “Infrastructure Week” efforts sputtered, Biden is expected to take a big swing at the issue and package together funding for expanded broadband networks, bridge and road repairs as well as technology that reduces greenhouse gasses. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday that Biden’s plan “will make historic investments in infrastructure — in the auto industry, in transit, in the power sector — creating millions of good union jobs, and in the process, also addressing the climate crisis head-on.”  But it’s unclear when the package will be officially unveiled. Biden said Jan. 14 he would lay out his recovery plan during his first appearance before a joint session of Congress the following month, but no date was announced. Psaki said Wednesday he would not detail plans for the next legislation until the coronavirus relief bill is passed and signed into law. Climate hawks and moderates disagree over reducing production of natural gas and whether to enact a tax on gasoline or carbon. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) is pushing a tax rebates for people who turn in internal-combustion engines and buy electric cars. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), meanwhile, has discussed green energy initiatives with administration officials. And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) pointed to the energy crisis in Texas as reason to reinvest in the electric grid. ""Together, we must build back better an electric grid that’s cheaper, cleaner and more reliable,"" she said Wednesday. But whether Biden will try to roll these major goals into one package appears uncertain. Senior Democrats have discussed the possibility that the package could be cleaved into separate, smaller pieces of legislation that could be passed through Congress on a piecemeal basis, particularly if Republicans are willing to support a stand-alone bipartisan infrastructure deal. Democrats have supported expediting Biden’s coronavirus relief package with no GOP votes, but centrist lawmakers could balk again approving the measure through the budget procedure known as reconciliation.  “I'm still trying to get my head wrapped around how we use reconciliation without undermining our success working across the aisle,” said Sen. Thomas Carper (D-Del.), the new chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Yet he and other Democrats say climate change is too urgent of a problem for the party to do nothing when it has full control of Congress and the White House. “We may come to a point where it's impossible to find common ground with our Republican colleagues, and we'll have to resort to reconciliation,” Carper said.  Some environmental advocates are arguing that a go-it-alone strategy could be the only way to get one of Biden's biggest environmental priorities into law: eliminating greenhouse gas pollution from power plants by 2035. Two left-leaning groups, Evergreen Action and Data for Progress, have sketched out several ways of trying to put zero-emissions requirements on electric utilities through the budget-writing process.  There is some momentum among Democrats to pursue that strategy. “The most important thing is that we listen really carefully, we build a broad coalition and we keep all of the options that we have on the table to get this done, including reconciliation,” said Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.).  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, noted temperature fluctuations are already posing a risk to her state’s cherry crops. She does not want to wait until the next farm package, due in 2023, to start offering more aid to growers. “We can't wait until the next farm bill,” she said. “This is very serious and I feel a great sense of urgency to get started on the things that need to be done. So I'm going to look for whatever vehicle will allow us to do that.” Read more here:  Mostly united over covid relief, Democrats face divisions over Biden’s massive second economic plan (Erica Werner, Jeff Stein and Dino Grandoni) About half a million people still lack power in Texas, down from a peak of more than 4 million earlier in the week. The Biden administration has said that it will provide emergency power generators and diesel to the state. Meanwhile, the chief executive of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the state’s grid operator, is under pressure to resign. The crisis isn't over: “The second major winter storm to hit Texas in quick succession is predicted to spread disruptive amounts of frozen precipitation from northern Louisiana and Mississippi through the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast through early Friday. Meanwhile, San Antonio and Austin may be brushed with one more rounds of snow Thursday before conditions finally start to improve by the weekend,” our colleagues with the Capitol Weather Gang report. The Fox News pundit again falsely claimed on his program Wednesday evening that frozen wind turbines are the main reason for the power outages in Texas, claiming that “journalists and the politicians they exist to protect are lying to you"" if they say otherwise. In reality: The state's own grid officials say the loss of power from thermal plants — that is, gas, coal and nuclear — is significantly greater than decline in output expected from the stalled wind turbines. Just as wind turbines can seize up in the cold, so too can instrumentation at traditional power plants freeze over if they are not built properly for the winter weather. Meanwhile, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) defended comments he made during a recent Fox News interview, in which he blamed the state's power failures on wind turbines without mentioning the loss of power from other energy sources. “What I made clear was the fact that if we relied solely upon green energy, that would be a challenge,” he said Wednesday. An inspector general report obtained by The Washington Post found that the housing agency had failed to identify health risks to residents of public housing near toxic waste dumps in an East Chicago, Ind., apartment complex, our colleague Tracy Jan reports. The West Calumet Housing Complex was built in 1972 atop a former lead smelting plant. Even after the Environmental Protection Agency discovered high levels of lead in 1985, HUD’s Indianapolis field office did not conduct the required environmental reviews. The apartment complex was deemed uninhabitable in 2016. The housing agency repeatedly failed to enforce its environmental regulations, despite investigations by federal and state health departments that found elevated blood lead levels in children living near the site.  The package would protect more than 1.3 million acres as wilderness in the West and prohibit new uranium mining near the Grand Canyon, Bloomberg News reports. The legislation contains eight different conservation or wilderness bills that the House passed last year but which languished in the GOP-controlled Senate. If the legislation is more successful this time around with Democrats in control of the Senate, it could help Biden achieve his goal of conserving 30 percent of all U.S. lands and waters by 2030. The automaker announced that it plans to spend $1 billion to revamp its factory in Cologne, Germany to produce a new battery-powered car that uses Volkswagen’s mechanical framework, the Associated Press reports. The company expects two-thirds of all of its European commercial vehicle sales to be electric or plug-in hybrids by 2030, and all of its passenger vehicles to be battery-electric. When water temperatures drop below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, the endangered sea turtles can enter a state of hypothermic shock, floating comatose above the water and sometimes washing ashore, our colleague Teo Armus reports. Such temperatures are a rarity in South Padre Island, and in a normal year, volunteers might rescue anywhere from a few dozen to a few hundred turtles. This year has been different. As thousands of cold-stunned sea turtles started washing up around Texas’s South Padre Island amid record-low temperatures, volunteers have sprung into action. By late Tuesday, volunteers with Sea Turtle, Inc., had transported 3,500 turtles for rehabilitation at the town's convention center, Armus writes.",The Energy 202: Democrats eye climate in big infrastructure push
194,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/02/17/energy-202-frozen-wind-turbines-arent-why-texas-cant-keep-lights/,WP,Towards Left,"with Alexandra Ellerbeck It's not just wind turbines. The whole Texas power system wasn't ready for this.  The ongoing electricity crisis in the Lone Star State hasn't stopped a chorus of conservative pundits and even some Republican lawmakers from pointing fingers at the state's fleet of wind turbines as the reason for the rolling blackouts, as nearly 3 million remain without power throughout the state. Even the state's own governor, Greg Abbott (R), joined in. In reality, frozen wind turbines are just a small part of a much bigger problem. All types of energy systems in Texas are struggling with subfreezing temperatures. The rolling blackouts are the result of a systematic failure of Texas's power plant and grid operators to prepare for a record-shattering Arctic freeze. It is Texas's traditional thermal power plants, which rely mostly on natural gas, that were supposed to provide the bulk of power during the harshest winter months, but failed to do so, according to Texas grid officials and outside energy experts.  “The entire system was overwhelmed,” said Joshua Rhodes, a research associate on energy issues at the University of Texas at Austin. The crisis in Texas shows the degree to which energy policy has been politicized along party lines in the United States. Abbott, Texas's governor, suggested on Fox News Tuesday that the crisis unfolding his state “shows how the Green New Deal would be a deadly deal,"" referring to a sweeping manifesto from progressive Democrats to cut greenhouse-gas emissions that was never implemented in his state. He went on to single out renewables for Texas's power woes, saying “our wind and our solar got shut down,"" without mentioning the steep decline in output from gas, coal and nuclear plants during the cold snap. Anchors elsewhere on the conservative news network spent much of Tuesday making dubious ties between the outages in Texas and proposals from Democrats for building out renewable energy resources in order to tackle climate change  Under the chyron “Texas Power Issues Blamed on Frozen Wind Turbines,” for example, host Pete Hegseth asked, “Is this what America would look like under the Green New Deal?” Another Fox News host, Dana Perino, similarly said the outages are “raising questions about the Lone Star State’s increasing reliance on renewable energy.”  Meanwhile on Twitter, GOP lawmakers such Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) linked the outages to the growth of Texas's renewable energy sector. The loss of power from thermal plants — that is, gas, coal and nuclear — is more than five times greater than decline in output expected from the stalled wind turbines, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, with manages most of the state's grid. Texas only planned to get a tenth of its power anyways from wind energy during the peak winter season. “There is significantly more megawatts in that thermal unit category than in the renewable category, as far as what's out during this particular event,” Dan Woodfin, a senior director for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, told reporters Tuesday. Sky-high demand for gas for heating homes during the winter chill, along with power plant equipment designed for warmer weather being hobbled by frigid temperatures, is what is straining output from the state's gas, coal and nuclear generators during the cold snap. More fundamentally, well before the storm Texas declined to put in place financial incentives for power producers to prepare for winter and ensure they could meet energy needs during periods of extreme demand, as our colleague Will Englund explains.  The Lone Star State also runs an electric grid largely disconnected from the rest of the country, allowing it to operate with less federal scrutiny but making it difficult to draw power from neighboring regions during times of crisis. Iced wind turbines, said Daniel Cohan, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rice University in Houston, are “so far down the list of what has gone wrong.” “Overall,"" he added, ""wind has come closer to expectations than many other sources.” Some have died as they turn to unsafe methods to stay warm amid the widespread power outages. A woman and girl died of carbon monoxide poisoning in Houston after leaving a car running to stay warm, our colleagues report. Three people died in North Carolina after a tornado associated with the storm system, which has drawn Arctic air south, hit a seaside town. Others have died in car accidents or from exposure. The technology company said that it would cut emissions 65 percent compared to 2010 levels within five years, the Verge reports. By the end of the decade, the company said 90 percent of its electricity would come from renewables, with any remaining carbon emissions offset through the use of carbon capture technology. But the company’s commitment does not include indirect emissions from its supply chain or from the use of its products by consumers. Competitions Microsoft and Amazon, by contrast, have included these emission sources in their climate pledges. (Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and executive chair of its board owns The Washington Post). The Environmental Protection Agency released annual data showing a significant decline in toxic power plant emissions, which are known to cause health problems. The 2020 data show that emissions of sulfur dioxide declined 19 percent compared to 2019; emissions of nitrogen oxides dropped 16 percent; and mercury emissions declined 17 percent. Last year’s decline is part of a steady downward trend largely related to changes in the mix of fuels used to generate energy. That trend has seen annual emissions of sulfur dioxide decline by 95 percent from 1990 to 2020 and annual emissions of nitrogen oxides fall by 88 percent. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will hold the hearing for President Biden’s interior secretary nominee next week. If confirmed, Haaland would be the first Native American to run the Department of the Interior. Haaland has faced opposition from some Republicans, who have seized on her support for the New Green Deal and used her nomination as a venue to criticize the Biden administration’s commitment to ending new oil and gas leases on federal lands. But Democrats likely have the votes to confirm her. State fisheries employees said that they needed sturgeon eggs for research. Instead, Ryan P. Koenigs, an official with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, traded the eggs – which are highly prized among chefs for their briny flavor – to a caviar processor in exchange for $20,000 in jars of caviar, the New York Times reports. “The arrest of Mr. Koenigs last week, along with three other people who were not state employees, followed a three-year investigation by the state and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. A former supervisor of the fisheries unit told investigators that employees would accept caviar and eat some of it during team meetings, take some for personal use and give some to bars, according to prosecutors,” the Times writes. The spacecraft carrying NASA’s Mars rover Perseverance is expected to arrive Thursday on Mars at a speed of 12,000 miles an hour. Its arrival in the atmosphere will trigger a harrowing seven minutes of entry, descent and landing, during which everything must operate perfectly, our colleagues Joel Achenbach, Ben Guarino and Christian Davenport report. The rover is aiming to land in Jezero Crater, a 30-mile-wide basin that contains the remnants of an ancient river delta. It’s a much harder target than previous rover missions. “Hitting the 4.8-mile-wide landing site targeted by NASA after a journey of 300 million miles is akin to throwing a dart from the White House and scoring a bull’s eye in Dallas,” our colleagues write.",The Energy 202: Frozen wind turbines aren't why Texas can't keep the lights on
195,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/02/16/energy-202-how-bitter-cold-snap-is-crippling-power-texas/,WP,Towards Left,"with Alexandra Ellerbeck Millions of Texans have been plunged into darkness as the state's electric grid strains to provide power during a historic cold spell. The bone-chilling winter weather is bringing into stark relief the vulnerabilities of the electricity system as over 4 million customers in Texas remain without power Tuesday morning in a state that prides itself as the energy capital of the world. A cocktail of high power demand, strained gas supply, iced wind turbines and an independent streak that bleeds into how Texas runs its grid has led to widespread and persistent outages stranding people without power to hunker down in their homes as temperatures remain dangerously below freezing. Much of the situation behind the blackouts remains unknown. But the outages in Texas, coming just months after rolling blackouts roiled California during another extreme weather event, highlight how the changing climate is poised to test the mettle of the power sector — both in Texas and throughout the rest of the country. Around 34 gigawatts of electricity generation has been forced off the state's main grid during the cold snap — equal to more than 16 Hoover Dams running at full capacity.  The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages about 90 percent of the state’s electric load, said thermal power plants, which include gas, coal and nuclear, as well renewables have been adversely affected by the icy weather.  Surging demand for natural gas amid the Arctic blast is driving up prices and making fuel scarce, according to the grid operator. Gas utilities prioritize providing fuel for heating households ahead of selling it to gas-fired power plants.  Texas is also contending with reduced output from its many wind turbines as ice accumulates on blades during the cold, wet weather, grid operators added. Though traditionally associated with the oil and gas industry, the state now leads the nation in wind power generation. Other power plant infrastructure is vulnerable to the cold, too, if fuel lines crack, water intake systems clog with ice or piles of coal literally freeze over, though it is still unclear what specific problems power plants in Texas are having. Beyond power generation, snapped tree limbs have downed distribution lines as trees succumb to the unusually bitter cold. And many Texas homeowners, never expecting such a long-lasting freeze, have not insulated their homes like those to the north do — further overworking the grid. “Every grid operator and every electric company is fighting to restore power right now,” ERCOT president and chief executive Bill Magness said. That lets Texas avoid dealing much with the federal government when it comes to its grid. But that gives the state's grid operator few ways of drawing power from neighboring states during times of extreme energy demand. “One state over might be doing just fine where Texas could be struggling because there's no way to move power between those two states,” said Joshua Rhodes, a researcher at the Webber Energy Group at the University of Texas at Austin. Overnight, outrages of more than 100,000 customers spread to Kentucky, Oregon and West Virginia, according to the tracker poweroutage.us. But no state had as many homes without power as Texas. The electricity market in Texas is also set up differently from many other states.  While other regions pay power companies to make sure they have generators on call during times of high demand, Texas electricity customers pay only for the power actually provided. That leads to lower prices during normal times, but risks the reliability of the grid when demand for electricity spikes. Fox News host Tucker Carlson faulted Texas for being “recklessly reliant on so-called alternative energy, meaning windmills"" on his program Monday evening. The Wall Street Journal's editorial board piled on, solely blaming ""frozen wind turbines"" for Texas's power problems. But that criticism is misleading. While Texas's capacity to generate energy from the wind is down with some turbines seized up, most of the power generation offline during the cold spell was supposed to come from traditional thermal plants, Texas's grid operator said Monday. It is a redux of what happened in California after a severe heat wave in August pushed California's grid to the brink, prompting then-President Donald Trump and other Republicans to blame the blue state for shifting away from fossil fuels. ClearView Energy Partners, a Washington-based research firm, wrote in a note Monday it expects “at least a few renewable power critics may point to Texas’ woes as reasons to evaluate, if not temper, the transition toward cleaner intermittent resources.”  The firm, however, added it doesn't expect Texas lawmakers to “adopt measures that would meaningfully undermine” renewables, now a major industry in Texas. In New England, for example, gas-fired generators can switch to burning oil if gas demand spikes, while wind turbines in the Midwest have systems to de-ice blades, said Jesse Jenkins, an assistant professor and energy systems engineer at Princeton. “The regions that are used to this kind of weather have strategies for dealing with it,” he said. “And Texas has not really planned for implementing those strategies.” As the atmosphere warms due to the burning of fossil fuels and other human activity, cold snaps have become more rare. But there is evidence the melting of sea ice in the Arctic may coax frigid polar air south and cause severe cold snaps like the one this week, though not all climate scientists agree on that explanation.  “I personally don't think anyone's really to blame,” Rhodes said. “This is a black swan event.”  He added now going forward, “I hope we decide to plan for it.” In a federal court filing late last week, the Environmental Protection Agency said it instead hopes to propose a new rule aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the nation’s power plants, our colleagues Brady Dennis and Juliet Eilperin report.  The Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan set climate pollution targets for every state’s electricity sector, with a goal of reducing carbon emissions from power plants by 32 percent nationally before 2030. The plan ran into legal challenges from Republican states and was replaced with a more lenient rule by the Trump administration. Last month, a federal court scrapped the Trump administration’s repeal and replacement of the Clean Power Plan. But rather than revive the Obama-era regulation, the Biden administration is seeking the court’s blessing to start with a clean slate. The emissions reduction targets of the Clean Power Plan have largely been met due to changes in electricity generation and fall far short of what would be needed to fulfill President Biden’s promise to make the electricity sector carbon-neutral by 2035. Biden’s ambitions may face limitations, however, from a conservative Supreme Court, which could limit the scope of executive action that the administration can take to curb emissions. The chemicals that supermarkets use to keep foods cold are leaking at higher rates than regulators have assumed, according to the findings of an undercover investigation by an advocacy group, Eilperin and Desmond Butler report. Most of these refrigerant chemicals are hydrofluorocarbons — greenhouse gases that are thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide and which could become the target of increased federal regulation under the Biden administration. Undercover investigators for the Environmental Investigation Agency used high tech sensors to identify leakage of hydrofluorocarbons at 55 percent of the 45 supermarkets that they surveyed in D.C., Maryland and Virginia. The investigators limited their study to a regional sample and were unable to measure the amount of leakage. But the fact that some leaks persisted for months after they were first detected may suggest that some supermarket chains are failing to do regular monitoring. Biden’s executive order last month calling on the United States to promote the end of international financing of fossil fuel projects could end U.S. funding for coal projects, but it may leave more countries turning to China for financing. “Biden's directive last month to move toward withholding money from international institutions like the World Bank that help poor nations build fossil fuel power plants stands in stark contrast to Beijing's flow of cash under its Belt and Road Initiative, which supplies 70 percent of the financing for the world's new coal-fired plants,” Politico reports. White House officials hope that the move will show China’s hypocrisy in promising environmental efforts at home while funding pollution abroad. But withdrawing U.S. funding for fossil fuel projects may not be enough to convince countries to change their energy plan or lure them away from China’s coal finance.  Instead, the United States may need to work with other nations to build joint financing of green projects, or even consider working with China on parallel initiatives to leverage their financing toward greener alternatives, experts say. The Microsoft co-founder has outlined a plan to combat climate change in his new book, “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,” which focuses heavily on the role of innovation in making it cheaper and more politically feasible for countries to combat climate change. Gates says that new breakthroughs are needed in everything from the way we make cement to the meat we put in our burgers.  Gates says he has personally invested $2 billion in clean tech, according to the Wall Street Journal. But he says governments must also ramp up their investments. Zoos and sanctuaries often play match-maker for breeding. But the Duke Lemur Center in North Carolina is working to pair elderly lemurs long past breeding age, as part of an effort to ensure that the lemurs have companionship in their twilight days, the New York Times reports. To do so, the center is sometimes pairing lemurs of different species, like Cheyenne, a 32-year-old red-bellied lemur and Chloris, a ring-tailed lemur of the same age who suffers from cataracts and arthritis in her tail. Different species of lemurs rarely interact in the wild, but in captivity the lemurs appear to build tight social bonds across species. “Our goal is that no lemurs live alone,” Britt Keith, the head lemur keeper, told the New York Times. “It’s totally unnatural and not good for their well-being.”",The Energy 202: How a bitter cold snap is crippling power in Texas
196,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/02/19/climate-paris-accord/,WP,Towards Left,"The United States officially has rejoined the Paris climate accord. That was the easy part. After a four-year-stretch in which President Donald Trump repeatedly disparaged the international agreement and withdrew the country from it, Friday marked the return of United States to the global effort to prevent the planet from warming past a critical climate change threshold. Now, the Biden administration is vowing to make up for what it says is lost time and to repair the country’s standing among nations after President Donald Trump made the United States the only nation to drop out of the accord. From his first moments in office, President Biden signaled he is serious about curbing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and prodding other nations to do the same. Hours after being sworn in, he sent a letter to the United Nations kick-starting the 30-day process to rejoin the landmark 2015 accord that had been brokered under his old boss, President Barack Obama. “We can no longer delay or do the bare minimum to address climate change,” Biden said in remarks at the virtual Munich Security Conference on Friday. “This is a global, existential crisis, and we’ll all suffer — we’ll all suffer the consequences if we fail.” Fulfilling that campaign promise amounts to a stark repudiation of Trump, who spent years dismissing the global scientific consensus that human activity is causing the planet to warm. Although the United States technically was out of the Paris accord for only 107 days, Biden’s to-do list is lengthy. Biden vows monumental action on climate change as the fight with the fossil fuel industry begins The administration plans to ratchet up the U.S. commitments to reducing emissions while pressing countries including China and India to curtail construction of coal-fired plants and urging Brazil to preserve more of the Amazon rainforest. At the same time, Biden will have to contend with a deeply divided Congress and other competing factions at home as his administration crafts a regulatory and legislative agenda for cutting emissions. The Biden administration is reentering the agreement with pomp — but also a measure of humility. On Friday, former secretary of state John F. Kerry, Biden’s special climate envoy, made several appearances in which he apologized for the nation’s absence from the global stage during the Trump years and said the United States will work hard to make its actions match its promises. “We can’t talk our way back into legitimacy,” Kerry said during one event alongside ambassadors from Italy and Britain. “We have to earn our way back.” The White House is planning to host a summit of world leaders on April 22, Earth Day, as a prelude to a critical U.N. climate conference in Scotland in November; nations will be expected to arrive with climate pledges that exceed the ambitions of the Paris accord. Existing commitments to cut emissions are, according to many estimates, woefully inadequate for forestalling dangerous warming that is already evident around the world in the form of larger and more frequent wildfires, harsher droughts, other extreme weather, melting glaciers, species losses and coastal flooding. Kerry on Friday acknowledged that the world is far behind where it needs to be to keep warming below a global average of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-Industrial levels. Now is the “decisive decade” for nations to rein in their emissions and prevent mass migration, food insecurity, species collapse and other calamities that could result from climate change, he said. “It’s what people will do in the next 10 years that matter,” Kerry said. “That’s what we have to talk about.” Biden has kicked off the process of setting a new national goal for cutting emissions that is exceeds Obama’s target of slashing carbon emissions by about a quarter below 2005 levels by 2025. But analysts say the United States is at risk of missing even that goal after Trump eased federal regulations that would have helped to rein in carbon pollution. Laurence Tubiana, the chief executive of the European Climate Foundation and an architect of the Paris accord, said that all countries need to sharply raise their emissions-cutting goals ahead of the summit but that the United States especially must make a bold new promise. “The science tells us this means a target of at least 50 percent [greenhouse gas] cuts on 2005 levels by 2030, ideally more,” she said. The World Resources Institute, a sustainability think tank, is pressing the Biden administration to set that 2030 goal, too. “Obviously, we lost four years of federal leadership during the Trump administration, which may make it more difficult to hit that 2025 target,” said Dan Lashof, WRI’s U.S. director. But he added, “What we need now is to raise ambition and set a path for the next decade.” After Trump’s decision to leave the Paris agreement, many U.S. cities, corporations, universities, nonprofit groups and some states undertook their own efforts to reduce their carbon footprints and keep the country on track through a coalition called We Are Still In. “Over the last four years, Americans across the country have continued pushing forward and cutting emissions,” billionaire and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg said on a call Thursday with reporters. “The reason is simple: They understand fighting climate change strengthens our economy and improves people’s health.” California, for instance, announced plans to phase out sales of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035, and New York has passed laws aiming to produce 100 percent zero-emission electricity by 2040. Bloomberg, who noted that coal plants had closed at a faster rate under Trump than under Obama, was a major funder behind that push on behalf of public officials and private industry in recent years. “It effectively held the line until this moment,” said Jeff Nesbit, the executive director of Climate Nexus, a firm that highlights climate effects and clean-energy initiatives across the country. Yet there is only so much that local governments can do on their own. To match whatever new goals Biden sets, the administration has directed agencies to begin unraveling Trump’s environmental policies and is preparing a major infrastructure bill with the aim of bolstering the push toward clean power and electric cars. Biden’s efforts to pass climate legislation to help meet Paris targets may be stymied by Republicans, many of whom represent fossil fuel-producing states and oppose his decision to reenter the Paris agreement. “At the very least, I urge President Biden to do what the Obama administration refused to do and submit the Paris agreement to the Senate,” Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) said last month. Activists abroad, such as Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, the founder of the Association for Indigenous Women and Peoples of Chad, also have pushed the United States to act with urgency, noting the devastating effects in developing countries if the rest of the world doesn’t curb carbon pollution. “We lost four years when Donald Trump decided to withdraw from the Paris agreement,” she told reporters this week. “During those four years, consequences for developing countries have been terrible. In Chad, my country, we have faced drought, floods, [destruction] of our crops, heat waves. That has caused food insecurity, conflict between communities and increasing conflict between regions just to access natural resources.” Like others around the world, she welcomed the U.S. reentry into the global fight to combat climate change. But she said that just cutting U.S. emissions is not enough. Rather, the United States must help poorer and more vulnerable nations by supporting the Green Climate Fund, a U.N. program that helps developing nations with adaptation and mitigation projects. “We need the U.S. to stand with us and help who are leading these battles today,” she said. Friday afternoon, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres became the latest dignitary to welcome the United States back into the global effort on climate change. “Today is a day of hope,” he said in a virtual event alongside Kerry. But he quickly said that despite the U.S. return, 2021 remains a make-or-break year for putting the world on a more sustainable trajectory. “Governments will take decisions that will determine the future of people and planet,” Guterres said, adding, “The Paris agreement is our pact with our descendants and the whole human family. This is the race of our lifetimes. We must go much faster, and much farther.”","U.S. officially rejoins Paris accord, vowing to make up for lost time"
197,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/02/19/haaland-interior-native-american/,WP,Towards Left,"As Rep. Deb Haaland prepares for a Senate hearing Tuesday that could make her the first Native American in history to lead the Interior Department, her supporters are listening to Republican opposition to her nomination with worry — and anger. Haaland, a New Mexico Democrat, is expected to face sharp questioning from GOP members on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee regarding her opposition to new oil and gas drilling leases on federal land — a position she shares with President Biden. Her lifetime score on environmental issues with the League of Conservation Voters is 98 percent. In addition to breaking a barrier at Interior, Haaland would be the first Native American Cabinet secretary. In a letter to Biden last month, congressional Republicans asked him to revoke her historic nomination over their concerns. At least one Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, the committee chairman, has said he has not decided how he will vote. But in a mid-January interview with The Washington Post, Manchin said he’s “always been deferential to whoever the president” picks for his Cabinet. Unlike the bipartisan approvals enjoyed by the last two nominees to run Interior, Haaland’s nomination may face a tie vote on the committee, which is composed of 10 Democrats and 10 Republicans. In that case, Democrats would still be able to bring Haaland’s nomination to the full Senate for a vote following several procedural steps. Native Americans are letting the senators know they’re watching. On reservations, at think tanks, in cultural groups and lobbying organizations, American Indians who celebrated Haaland’s selection are working to push it through to confirmation. They are organizing a multicultural coalition stretching from Washington, D.C., to her home state of New Mexico to Montana and Oregon to voice support for Haaland. The Rocky Mountain Tribal Leaders Council erected two billboards Thursday with Haaland’s picture in Billings and Great Falls, Mont., the state represented by Haaland’s harshest critic, Sen. Steve Daines (R). Tom Rodgers, president of Global Indigenous Council, said the group wants to send a message to Daines, who has said he may try to block Haaland’s nomination. Daines has questioned Haaland’s qualifications to run a department that manages 73 million acres of land with vast energy resources, criticized her support for the Green New Deal, and has labeled her positions “radical.” “Even though he’s a senator from the state of Montana, his statements did not reflect the views of the tribes at all,” Holly Cook Macarro, chairwoman of the American Indian Graduate Center, said of Daines. Native people are nearly 10 percent of Montana’s population, she said. “We are not invisible.” As the billboards were erected in Montana, Haaland’s supporters lined up speakers for a virtual town hall to be held Monday before the hearing. Organizers plan a tweetstorm that will exhort supporters to contact their senators. They want the tweeting to continue the following day throughout the hearing. “You’re watching a big campaign unfold right now,” said Crystal EchoHawk, executive director of IllumiNative, a nonprofit group that works to use pop culture and media to undo Native American stereotypes. “There was a groundswell of support of her nomination and it was diverse and big,” EchoHawk said. “People have been hanging back and waiting, and now that we finally have a hearing date, we’re taking action. I think obviously part of the catalyst has been the absolute outrage that people have been expressing after seeing these statements Republicans have been making.” Judith LeBlanc, director of the Native Organizers Alliance, said the criticism of Haaland at such a historic moment stings. In addition to managing land, Interior oversees the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Country. “American Indians, we suffer from being erased from history. We were brought to our knees and forced into treaties. A huge majority of people think we don’t even exist,” LeBlanc said. “This department has the most impact on our daily lives. Land use, water use, health care, education and tribal governance. “This nomination has such grass roots pride about the fact that one of our people is being nominated. I’m an elder. I’m 69. I’ve never seen anything like this. We are being rewritten back into history.” Haaland is a member of the Laguna Pueblo Nation in New Mexico, where 30,000 drilling wells and numerous mineral mines dot the landscape. Native people have complained about the pollution caused by mining excavation for decades, along with the failure of companies to restore the land they damage to unearth resources. According to the New Mexico Oil & Gas Association, industry revenue put $800 million into state coffers in the last year and supports 134,000 jobs directly and indirectly. During the Trump administration, the Department of the Interior increased federal leases, expanded drilling on public land and relaxed regulations against pollution and harming wildlife. That prompted Haaland to say, “The last thing we need are more fossil fuel projects on public land,” according to a 2019 story posted on her website. A U.S. Geological Survey study noted that a quarter of all carbon emissions in the United States comes from fossil fuel production on federal land. Haaland, who attended protest of the North Dakota Pipeline at Standing Rock, was an early backer of the Green New Deal that seeks to dramatically lower greenhouse gas emissions and promote renewable energy. Republicans have attacked the plan as an attempt to erase the fossil fuel industry and cut jobs. The Jan. 26 letter from Republicans that asked Biden to revoke Haaland’s nomination said her goal to stop all oil and gas leasing on federal lands would kill “an industry that provided more than $8 billion in revenue to the United States in 2019 alone.” Not only does Haaland reject “America’s leadership as a net exporter of petroleum, but also has actively fought to oppose high-wage mining jobs,” according to the letter. Montana state Rep. Jonathan Windy Boy (D-Box Elder Reservation and Fort Belknap) scoffed at the criticism: “She has enough sense not to oppose anything and everything,” he said. “They don’t think she’s qualified … based upon her views,” Windy Boy said. “It’s unfortunate because they haven’t given her the chance to do anything. Look at four years ago. People were nominated who didn’t have the qualifications Deb has now and [Republicans] didn’t question any of those unqualified candidates.” Windy Boy was referring to Ryan Zinke, a former U.S. representative from Montana who was Trump’s first interior secretary. Zinke was a staunch advocate of drilling and coal excavation whose nomination was approved 16-6 in committee. “There’s been that thread of conversation that has been misogynistic,” Macarro said. “The bar they’re setting for Deb to gain their support is ironic given their support for Ryan Zinke.” Julian Brave NoiseCat, one of the architects of the Green New Deal, said, “She’s a progressive, sure, that’s undeniable. But all of her colleagues love working with her, including Republicans who sing her praises. It makes me wonder as a Native person if they would be treating someone with a different background differently, and I think Native people have the same question.” Republicans would be unwise to overlook the historic significance of Haaland’s nomination, NoiseCat said. Native Americans live in the West, within deep red states, and have cultivated relationships with Republicans and don’t lean as heavily Democratic as African Americans. NoiseCat said the treatment of Native Americans by Republicans could push them to lean even more to the political left. “I think that one thing that could be happening here is that we might be seeing a realignment of Indian issues becoming a Democratic issues.” Jim Enote, chief executive of the Colorado Plateau Foundation, which funds Indian initiatives to protect food, water and historical artifacts, said he’s not a part of the campaign to support Haaland but understands it. “Many people are rising in support of Deb Haaland because she embodies the fact that 21st century Native Americans are not a generation of sufferers,” Enote said. “We are capable of solving the most difficult problems facing our world. She’s is in touch with the land and water issues that are so emblematic of the problems we face as a nation.” “She is a powerful message to Native Americans and Americans that we are stepping into higher ground,” he said. “We are not your mascots.” Dino Grandoni contributed to this story.",Deb Haaland’s nomination to lead Interior is a historic first for Native Americans. The GOP wants Biden to cancel it.
198,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2021/02/18/climate-solutions-alps/,WP,Towards Left,"ST. CORONA AM WECHSEL, Austria — In this village at the foot of the easternmost reaches of the Alps, a ski town for four decades, the climate catastrophe became evident in December 2015. Villagers would usually be wearing puffy coats and knitted hats. Instead, a balmy 70 degrees Fahrenheit forced them into cargo pants. “I was sweating, in every sense,” said Karl Morgenbesser, a former ski instructor. At 34, he had just taken over as general manager of St. Corona’s once-bustling ski resort. A warming climate, however, was rendering skiing unappealing to investors. Public subsidies for the resort, which is owned by a development arm of the regional government, had already been cut off. If cold winters were disappearing, Morgenbesser thought, why not pivot to summer? Initially, the idea of reorienting the town’s economy from cold to warm weather was met with ridicule. Skiing is practiced by a third of Austrians, making the sport not just a major source of income but a cultural touchstone, too. But the sight of the muddy mountainside, dotted with tufts of grass at the beginning of the usually lucrative Christmas holidays, made villagers rally behind Morgenbesser. “It proved that we could no longer rely on skiing,” the father of two said. “In hindsight, it was a blessing in disguise.” In the five years since, St. Corona succeeded where hundreds of other low-lying ski resorts have struggled. It transitioned from a victim of climate change to an example of adaptation success. And it’s now leading the way for other communities nestled among the Alps. In summer 2016, St. Corona opened a summer toboggan course that’s akin to a roller coaster, as well as a bike park for children and an activity and climbing space. In 2017, those activities lured more than 7,000 paying visitors. That was enough justification for the regional government and the village, population 400, to invest further. They built landscaped summer hiking paths themed around ants and created rentals for stand-up paddleboards at the reservoir lake. Most importantly, Morgenbesser devised a vast network of mountain biking trails, suitable for every skill level and age group. In 2020, the village attracted more mountain bikers in summer than skiers in winter. About 200,000 visitors came to St. Corona last summer, 35,000 of whom were bikers. Many were from Vienna and opted to vacation closer to home during the coronavirus pandemic, as opposed to more traditional summer vacation spots in Spain and Greece. “Essentially, we doubled our numbers each year,” Morgenbesser said of the paying bikers. The summer season now offsets any losses incurred from unpredictable winters. “And summer is growing,” he said. Traversing France and Switzerland, then arching through Austria and swaths of Germany, Italy and Slovenia, the Alps are not only the most populated mountain range in the world but also the most visited. About 120 million tourists travel here each year, many of them lured by the 1,100 ski resorts that dot the slopes below its snow-capped peaks. But since the 1960s and ’70s, when skiing began driving the economies of thousands of villages, the Alps have warmed at twice the global average. Billions of dollars have been invested in snow-making technology. Elaborate networks of snow cannons that spit man-made powder over slopes were installed to guarantee a winter wonderland. European cities make way for more bikes during the coronavirus pandemic And yet if the climate warms by another 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, a third of resorts in the eastern half of the Alps will be too warm for snow — natural or man-made — to stick to the ground throughout the ski season. “When it’s too warm, the snow melts — period,” said Reto Knutti, a climate scientist and professor at Switzerland’s ETH Zurich university. “It’s simple physics.” St. Corona offers a blueprint for survival — and the ski industry is taking note. About 30 ski resorts in Austria, Italy and Switzerland have sent fact-finding delegations to the village. “We can definitely tell that summers are getting longer and warmer, and we need to offer something besides skiing,” said Armin Kuen, general manager of the tourism board of Fieberbrunn in western Austria, who recently joined his colleagues on a five-hour bus ride to St. Corona to learn about its adaptation. Mountain biking seemed like an obvious fit, but Fieberbrunn officials weren’t convinced. “They thought of these crazy, rowdy bikers darting down the mountain,” Kuen said. “And we’re more relaxed and very much about families.” When his group arrived on a sunny September afternoon last year, they did indeed spot daredevil bikers in protective gear. But they also found elderly people breezing uphill on electric bikes, children playing in the bike and climbing park while their parents ate brunch, and young couples checking out the once-dilapidated restaurant that had just reopened as a mid-century-style wedding venue. “It’s a prime example to make summer in the mountains attractive for literally anyone who can ride a bike, from downhill professionals to little ones and grandmas,” Kuen said. Fieberbrunn is now in the process of creating a biking trail for beginners. Neighboring Saalbach, due to host its second skiing world championships in 2025, already has a network of trails. Inspired by St. Corona, it plans to better integrate with the regional bus system so that specially outfitted buses can ferry cyclists and their bikes from the bottom of trails to the top. It has already modeled a bike park for small children after St. Corona’s. Schladming, which has twice hosted world ski championships, also took a page from St. Corona’s book. Though it had long invested in the summer season, downhill mountain biking had plateaued, said Georg Bliem, the general manager. A trip to St. Corona, he said, “was the most valuable fact-finding mission we took in the past 20 years.” With ease, the visitors from Schladming coasted down a mountain bike trail with banked curves and small jumps, all cleared of roots and pebbles. As soon as they returned home, they began building more than 11 miles of bike trails, a new children’s bike park and other attractions. The number of tickets sold in Schladming to warm-weather mountain bikers has ballooned from 9,000 in 2018 to 45,000 in 2020. And it’s growing. This year, an additional 4.5 miles of bike trails will be dug into the mountainside. While climate change reveals the benefits of diversification little by little, the pandemic lockdowns and travel restrictions have done so in an instant. France and Germany have kept their ski runs shut this winter, while Switzerland’s and Austria’s are largely devoid of foreign tourists. “The resorts that diversified, that have been offering hiking, culture, cycling, wellness, they’ve been doing much, much better” in coping with the economic impact of the crisis, said Matthias Horx, a German futurist who is examining the pandemic’s lasting impact on Alpine skiing. In the Alps quieted by pandemic, a mountaineer finds surprises The pandemic will reset the ski industry and prompt resorts to reconsider their investments, he said. In addition to its position as a thriving summer resort, St. Corona is now reaping an added benefit. Named after what some say is the patron saint of pandemics, the village is drawing day-trippers seeking to snap a photo of its street sign as well as pilgrims who want to pray at the altar of the saint. This winter has been surprisingly snowy in St. Corona. A new lift built last summer to tow mountain bikers up the peak is now pulling skiers. “With climate change, we need to be adaptable,” said Morgenbesser, whose name translates to “a better tomorrow.” He didn’t want to say what he thinks the future will hold — not in 20 years, or even in 10. He just offered simple advice: “Don’t bet on one horse.”",This Austrian ski resort is preparing for a snowless future
199,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/02/17/animals-texas-winter-storm-turtles/,WP,Towards Left,"The power is out, cellphone service is spotty and the water has stopped running for most of South Padre Island, a normally balmy beach town in the southernmost tip of Texas that has been chilled by a deadly winter storm. But amid freezing temperatures that show no signs of warming soon, dozens of residents have ventured on foot and by boat to rescue another species that makes its home here: The island’s famous — and endangered — sea turtles. By late Tuesday, volunteers working with Sea Turtle, Inc., a local rescue group, had transported more than 3,500 comatose turtles for rehabilitation at the town’s convention center. Conservationists look to gradually increase the animals’ body heat as they lie on tarps and kiddie pools indoors. A post shared by South Padre Island, Texas (@visitsouthpadreisland) But Wendy Knight, the executive director of Sea Turtle, Inc., fears that hundreds of those turtles rescued in Texas may have already succumbed to the cold. “It’s unprecedented,” she told The Washington Post. “A cold stun like this could have the potential to wipe out decades of hard work, and we’re going through it with no power and a unique, more catastrophic challenge to our efforts.” Dangerous Arctic chill leaves more than a dozen dead, widespread power outages across the southern U.S. As of early Wednesday, subzero temperatures and sustained power outages had left more than a dozen people dead around the U.S. And animals, too, have also felt the brunt of an Arctic chill that has pummeled Texas and the southern United States. Near Houston, more than a dozen dogs were rescued from the freezing cold, with the remains of at least one found in the snow. Shelters in Austin and the Texas Panhandle pleaded with the public for generators and scrambled to defrost wells. At a primate sanctuary in San Antonio, monkeys, lemurs and at least one chimpanzee froze to death after electricity went out at the 70-acre facility. “I never, ever thought my office would turn into a morgue, but it has,” Brooke Chavez, the director of Primarily Primates, told the San Antonio Express-News. “We won’t truly know how many animals have died until the temperatures rise and the snow starts to melt.” The same is true of conditions on South Padre Island, where conservationists told The Post it often takes days for them to determine how many turtles have been able to survive as the reptiles slowly regain warmth. Sanjuana Zavala, a spokeswoman for Sea Turtle, Inc., said green sea turtles live year-round in the Laguna Madre, a salty lagoon sandwiched between the mainland and barrier islands on Texas’s Gulf Coast. The turtles, sometimes called the “lawn mowers of the ocean,” thrive off the area’s thick, underwater vegetation and keep the ecosystem balanced. But when water temperatures drop below about 50 degrees Fahrenheit — a rarity in South Padre Island — the chill can cause them to become “cold stunned.” A turtle’s heart rate lowers, its flippers become paralyzed and its body will float comatose above the water, sometimes washing ashore, Zavala said. This state of hypothermic shock can put them at risk of predators, boats and even drowning. In a normal year, volunteers with Sea Turtle, Inc. might rescue anywhere from a few dozen to a few hundred cold-stunned turtles, warming them inside the group’s rescue center. Yet before the weekend was up, they already appeared to be filling up their own space to the brim. “We knew this was not a regular cold stun,” she said, “and we knew we had to do something.” The turtle rescue put out a call for help, and soon, much of the island was involved in an all-hands-on-deck effort to transport turtles to an overflow facility at the South Padre Island Convention Centre, where generators and good insulation could keep the animals warm. Boats went out on Monday and Tuesday to scoop up cold-stunned turtles from the water, as other volunteers on foot scanned the beach and loaded up the reptiles into their car trunks and truck beds. “It is a huge, huge community effort,” said Gina McLellan, a 71-year-old retired professor and longtime volunteer. “We very often don’t even think about the [cold’s] impact on animals, because we’re so worried about our own electricity and water. With this kind of event, it’s a classic display of humanity toward animals.” McLellan said she spent hours outside the convention center participating in a kind of turtle bucket brigade: She and other volunteers would approach a long line of vehicles, dismount the animals onto dollies and then cart them over inside the center. Inside, the space looks like a football field, except “with turtles laying side-by-side-by-side, row-after-row."" Knight expressed her gratitude for the volunteers, but she added that their efforts will eventually become moot without additional help from the power grid. The Texas grid got crushed because its operators didn’t see the need to prepare for cold weather The “dry dock” rehabilitation method being used inside the convention center is far from ideal, she said. And dozens of injured and sick turtles at the rescue’s hospital — which has been without power for days — should be treated inside massive, heated tanks instead. “If we don’t get some relief from a power standpoint,” she said, “we’re not going to be able to sustain this.""",Volunteers race to save thousands of cold-stunned turtles washing up in Texas
200,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/02/15/these-gases-your-grocerys-freezer-are-fueling-climate-change-biden-wants-fix-that/,WP,Towards Left," Some of the climate impacts of a grocery store trip are obvious, like the fuel it takes to get there and the electricity that keeps its lights glowing, conveyor belts moving and scanners beeping. But then there are the invisible gases seeping out into the atmosphere when you reach for your ice cream of choice. In nearly every supermarket in America, a network of pipes transports compressed refrigerants that keep perishable goods cold. Most of these chemicals are hydrofluorocarbons — greenhouse gases thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide — which often escape through cracks or systems that were not properly installed. Once they leak, they are destined to pollute the atmosphere. The Biden administration now sees eliminating these chemicals from the nation’s refrigerators as low-hanging fruit in its broader effort to rein in climate pollutants. The Environmental Protection Agency issued a public call last week for companies to report production and import data on HFCs. Under the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, which passed in December, the EPA must phase down the production and import of these potent greenhouse gases 85 percent over the next 15 years. “The environmental benefits here are very large, they’re very important,” said Cindy Newberg, who directs the stratospheric protection division in the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation. The new law, she added, “provides explicit authority for us to do this work, and that’s incredibly important to the agency, and for all of us.” A new undercover investigation by an advocacy group suggests that some supermarkets are leaking climate-damaging refrigerants at an even higher rate than regulators have assumed. The industry estimates that every year supermarkets lose an average of 25 percent of their refrigerant charge — chemicals introduced in the 1990s to replace ones depleting the Earth’s ozone layer. Armed with high-tech sensors, undercover investigators for the Environmental Investigation Agency have documented widespread leakage of HFCs at grocery stores in D.C., Maryland and Virginia. While Walmart and other supermarket companies have pledged to curb their use of these chemicals, more than half of all the stores the EIA surveyed were emitting these climate-warming refrigerants. Out of 45 supermarkets surveyed — including 20 Walmarts as well as stores operated by ALDI, Costco, Giant, Harris Teeter, Safeway, ShopRite, PriceRite, Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods — investigators found leaks in 55 percent of them. (Whole Foods is owned by Amazon, whose founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post.) The investigation did not determine the exact amount of HFCs released. “This is a systemwide, industry-wide problem,” said Avipsa Mahapatra, climate lead for the EIA, the advocacy group. “In reality, they could easily check for this.” None of the companies contacted for this story provided a comment on the survey itself, but a few noted their commitment to curbing these pollutants. Whole Foods said it is “proud to be a leader among U.S. supermarkets in our efforts to reduce emissions of hydrofluorocarbons.” A little more than 30  of its stores have switched to carbon-dioxide refrigerants, and it touts one market in Brooklyn that has become 100 percent HFC-free. Walmart noted it has pledged to reach zero emissions across its operations within two decades, a goal that includes “transitioning to low-impact refrigerants for cooling and electrified equipment for heating in our stores, clubs and data and distribution centers by 2040.” Giant said it is also transitioning its stores to less climate-damaging refrigerants as part of a plan to halve its overall carbon emissions by 2030 and is also working with suppliers to make further cuts in its supply chain. “We have committed to working with our suppliers to reduce emissions from farm to fork,” said Felis Andrade, a spokeswoman for Giant’s parent company, Ahold Delhaize USA. Commercial refrigeration, which includes grocery stores as well as restaurants and food processing, accounts for about 28 percent of all U.S. emissions of HFCs. Air conditioning for commercial buildings and homes represents between 40 and 60 percent of emissions, according to federal data. The EIA survey was based on a limited sample in one region of the United States. The investigators were also not able to measure the overall quantity and rate of leakage. But it suggests that large supermarket chains may be unaware of the extent of the problem, and do not have regular monitoring in place. In some cases, the leaks persisted months after they were first detected. The investigators, who began their survey in 2019, used leak detectors that they could insert in refrigerators and freezers as well as an infrared camera that could film fugitive greenhouse gases. Tracking environmental actions under Biden The food retail sector represents one part of the puzzle of how to drastically cut back on emissions in the coming years. HFCs trap thousands of times more heat than carbon dioxide, and with increasing sales they are projected to represent nearly a fifth of all climate-warming emissions by mid-century. It’s a growing problem: The hotter the Earth gets, the more people need cooling infrastructure. According to new data released Friday, HFC emissions in the United States rose by 4 million metric tons between 2018 and 2019. The 38,000 supermarkets in the United States use thousands of pounds of HFCs each year, according to the EPA, with each store having the equivalent climate impact of 300 cars on the road. Taken together, it is equal to 49 billion pounds of coal being burned each year. While monitoring for leaks and upgrading refrigeration systems translate into long-term savings by reducing energy use, stores operating on tight margins cannot always afford it. Ratio Institute co-founder Jonathan Tan, whose organization works with the food retail industry, policymakers and conservationists on the issue, estimated that while it can cost a store between $50,000 to $100,000 to make repairs to a system, transitioning from current refrigerant to a less-potent greenhouse gas like carbon dioxide can cost between $1 million and $2.5 million. Walmart, for example, said private companies would need government help in making the transition. “We also believe that private and public sector action is needed to foster innovation and enable an economically viable phasedown of HFCs globally,” it said in a statement. Europe is making a swifter transition than the United States. Over 26,000 supermarkets in European countries are using lower-impact refrigerants, compared with 600 stores in the United States. The EPA has regulated earlier generations of refrigerants for decades under the 1987 Montreal Protocol, the landmark global treaty aimed at repairing the ozone layer. Those compounds — chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons — damaged the ozone layer that shields the Earth from damaging ultraviolet rays from the sun. HFCs made an appealing substitute because they didn’t deplete ozone, but they warmed the planet instead. In 2016, the Obama administration helped broker the Kigali Amendment, where countries pledged to phase down HFCs under the treaty. But the agency’s effort to regulate the refrigerants ran aground during the Trump administration. One rule identifying “unacceptable” uses of HFCs was partly overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2017. The administration rewrote the rule, but the same court ruled it failed to follow proper procedures and did not need to abolish the Obama-era requirements altogether. Last year, Trump officials withdrew another Obama-era rule, which required companies to detect and repair any leaks from any appliance or piece of equipment using more than 50 pounds of HFCs. President Donald Trump declined to submit the Kigali Amendment to the Senate for ratification: President Biden signed an executive order last month instructing his secretary of state to take that step. The federal government has pursued cases against grocery chains, and won, when it comes to leaks of older refrigerants that damage the ozone layer. In 2019, for example, Southeastern Grocers agreed to spend $4.2 million to reduce coolant leaks and pay a $300,000 civil penalty. But HFCs are in a different category. “EPA’s recognized that it is a significant contributor to climate change and has tried to take action,” said Tom Land, a longtime agency staffer who retired in 2019 after working on both international climate negotiations and the agency’s voluntary refrigerants program, GreenChill. “It basically had to stop, it didn’t have authority.” Food retailers that participate in the GreenChill program have a leak rate of 14.3 percent, nearly half the industry average. Kristen Taddonio, senior climate and energy adviser at the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, said in an interview that reinstating regulations mandating leak detection could help grocers make even greater reductions. “It’s like that old adage, you can’t manage what you can’t measure,” said Taddonio, who worked on energy efficiency at the EPA and the Energy Department between 2004 and 2015.

201,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/02/12/epa-jettison-major-obama-climate-rule-biden-eyes-bigger-push/,WP,Towards Left,"The Biden administration indicated Friday it will not try to resurrect the Clean Power Plan, a controversial Obama-era policy that set climate pollution targets for every state’s electricity sector and gave officials flexibility on how they would make those reductions by the end of the decade. Instead, the Environmental Protection Agency said in a federal judicial filing, the Biden administration is seeking a court’s blessing to propose a new rule aimed at limiting greenhouse gas pollution from the nation’s power plants, which represent the second-largest source of emissions. “As a practical matter, the reinstatement of the [Clean Power Plan] would not make sense,” Joseph Goffman, the acting assistant administrator for the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation, wrote in an accompanying memo to the agency’s regional offices. He noted that the deadline for states to submit their plans had passed and that “ongoing changes in electricity generation” mean the goals of the Obama-era regulation already had been met. The EPA did not detail what type of oversight it might pursue instead of the Clean Power Plan and declined to comment further Friday. But the Biden administration has made no secret of his intention to aggressively curb greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector, which has done more to cut its carbon output than any other part of the U.S. economy. Biden has pledged to make the electricity sector carbon-neutral by 2035. The Clean Power Plan, which mandated that power plants make 32 percent reductions in emissions below 2005 levels by 2030, would not put the nation on such a trajectory. Biden calls for 100 percent clean electricity by 2035. Here’s how far we have to go. The Clean Power Plan ran into legal trouble in 2016, as Republican attorneys general and others joined a lawsuit arguing that the Obama EPA had overstepped its authorities under the Clean Air Act. The Supreme Court halted enforcement of the plan until a lower court ruled on its legality. That legal fight remained unresolved when President Donald Trump took office in 2017. The Trump administration eventually replaced the Clean Power Plan with its own more lenient rule, which then-EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, signed in June 2019, saying that it would lower electricity costs. But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia vacated that effort, saying the goal of the Trump administration’s EPA had been “to slow the process for reduction of emissions,” and the court called that “arbitrary and capricious.” The three-judge panel said “the central operative terms” of the Trump rule “hinged on a fundamental misconstruction” of the Clean Air Act. President Biden had pitched the shift away from fossil fuels to cleaner forms of energy as a potential jobs boon for the United States, even as the oil, gas and coal industry has warned of the economic harm that some communities could face if the country moves too quickly. He also has begun a major effort to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles. “Transforming the American electric sector to produce power without carbon pollution will be a tremendous spur to job creation and economic competitiveness in the 21st century, not to mention the benefits to our health and to our environment,” Biden said late last month as he signed far-reaching executive actions focused on climate. In its filing on Friday, the EPA acknowledged that it is obligated to regulate emissions from electric-generating plants under the Clean Air Act and said it intends to “consider the question afresh.” Biden’s pick to lead the EPA, Michael Regan, made a similar point in his Senate confirmation hearing this month. Federal court scraps Trump administration’s power plant rule “Is it your understanding that the president intends to come back with a new version of the Clean Power Plan?” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) asked him at the time. “It's my understanding that we have to take a look at what [were] the plans for the Clean Power Plan and what were the plans for the ACE rule,” Regan said. “The reality is that it presents a significant opportunity for the Environmental Protection Agency to take a clean slate and look at how do we best move forward.” Regan added that he plans to convene people from across the spectrum with a stake in how the EPA oversees the power sector to “think about how we harness the power and the statutory authority of the Clean Air Act in concert with major investments that we should see government-wide and the input and the statements from those who will be impacted by any potential actions we take.” If the United States is to live up to Biden’s ambitious plans for climate action, the country will need to tackle its largest sources of emissions. New data released by the EPA on Friday shows that while emissions from the power sector continue to fall, declining 8.3 percent between 2018 and 2019, it remains the nation’s second-largest source of greenhouse gas pollution. The biggest source, transportation, has continued to climb. Its emissions rose by 1 percent between 2018 and 2019, according to the draft report, while the carbon output of the country’s agricultural, industrial and residential sector also increased. Overall U.S. greenhouse gas emissions dipped just 1.7 percent between 2018 and 2019, according to the draft report. While carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide fell slightly, two other powerful greenhouse gases rose — including methane, which is released by animals and oil and gas operations. And while the pandemic-induced economic slowdown is likely to lower the U.S. carbon footprint for 2020, experts expect emissions to start rising again as the economy recovers and Americans begin traveling more. Ann Weeks, legal director for the Clean Air Task Force, said in an email that the EPA’s filing on Friday shows the agency “is looking to erase any ambiguity in the Court’s decision, to allow it to craft a rule that meets today’s realities, rather than having the Clean Power Plan spring back to life.” The legal question of how aggressively the new administration can move to curb carbon emissions from the power sector is not entirely resolved, since the conservative-leaning Supreme Court could ultimately rule against the Biden administration if it pushes the boundaries of what’s allowed under its executive authority. Jeff Holmstead, a partner at Bracewell LLC who headed the EPA’s air office under George W. Bush, said “there will be pressure from some environmental groups for them to do a more aggressive version” of the Obama-era rule, “but they know this is unlikely to pass muster in the Supreme Court.” Given the long-standing battles on this issue, he added, “anything the Biden administration does to regulate carbon emissions from power plants will almost certainly go to the Supreme Court.” West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey (R), who led the legal challenge to the Clean Power Plan and was able to get the Supreme Court to stay the rule, said in an email Friday that he will be watching carefully to see what the new administration does in the months ahead. “There are clear limits to the EPA’s authority in this area,” Morrisey said, “and our state-based coalition will work vigorously to enforce those limits and ensure that West Virginian and American energy and manufacturing jobs are protected from unlawful federal overreach.” Anu Narayanswamy contributed to this report.","EPA to jettison major Obama climate rule, as Biden eyes a bigger push"
202,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/02/10/carbon-dioxide-device-coronavirus/,WP,Towards Left,"With its five wall-length windows, Nick Crandall’s restaurant, Railroad Pub & Pizza, can bring in a lot of outside air. In late December, though, Washington state regulators said the restaurant could not qualify as “outdoor” dining, and would have to close because of heightened coronavirus restrictions. So Crandall went to Facebook to protest, giving a video tour of the Burlington, Wash., pub and its vast, garage-door-style windows. “I’m just kind of curious on what the science is for outdoor dining, how much airflow you need to do,” he said. He took aim at the state’s Democratic governor, Jay Inslee, suggesting he use “common sense.” The video was viewed over 73,000 times. It may sound like yet another politicized, Trump-era battle over coronavirus restrictions — yet this one ended in something that looks less like polarization and more like compromise. After Crandall and others complained and took to the media, state regulators introduced a new policy, which appears to be one of the first of its kind, allowing certain restaurants to count as “open air” dining even if they have four walls. In a new pandemic trend, these establishments can open up large windows or doors and actively measure levels of carbon dioxide, the gas we all exhale when breathing, as a key indicator of how much fresh air is circulating. Now Crandall’s restaurant is open again — with a CO2 monitor that displays a reading he tries to keep under 450 parts per million, only slightly higher than levels in the outside air, per state policy. Thanks to the human burning of fossil fuels, outdoor levels currently average about 415 parts per million, and are steadily rising. It’s part of a new wave as scientists, citizens and businesses including gyms, restaurants and bars try to quantify the airborne coronavirus risk in hopes of staying open. Sales of handheld carbon dioxide monitors have boomed, so much that one popular model, the $250 Aranet4, sold out rapidly, requiring its Latvia-based manufacturer, SAF Tehnika, to dramatically ramp up production. “We did not expect to, you know, have this increase so exponential,” said Toms Rekšņa, marketing director for the Aranet, speaking from the country’s capital, Riga. Catch up on the most important developments in the pandemic with our coronavirus newsletter. All stories in it are free to access. The trend is also catching on fast with a number of coronavirus activists — or citizen scientists — who tweet out their readings in different locations and use the hashtag #covidco2. In Australia, a group of “CO2Guerillas” have been documenting measurements in grocery stores, doctor’s offices, and businesses, often displaying very high levels of carbon dioxide. In Japan, the use of monitors is also catching on, including on a massive screen recently at a concert venue. The impetus for measuring carbon dioxide is simple: An increasingly powerful body of evidence suggests the coronavirus is airborne, capable of traveling distances well beyond six feet in tiny aerosols released when infected people talk, shout, sing or just breathe. But there’s currently no sensor that can monitor, in real time, whether these infectious aerosols are floating around us when we’re indoors. But carbon dioxide can, in some ways, act as a proxy. People exhale it when they breathe, and the gas builds up in indoor spaces that aren’t well ventilated, reaching concentrations far above the baseline level of outside air. “It gives you some insight into ventilation, which is really hard to figure out otherwise,"" explains Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. ""Even building owners and managers often don’t know much about the ventilation. The person who knows is the person who installed it, and they are usually long gone.” Marr is a medical adviser to the network of CrossFit gyms — installing indoor monitors is now part of their coronavirus guidelines, at her urging. Longtime experts on indoor air say the heightened attention to ventilation is very valuable, and that carbon dioxide measurements can definitely be useful. Yet amid the grass-roots frenzy to find the next gadget that can confer a safety edge during the pandemic, some worry about misunderstandings. “It is a piece of information, not a smoking gun,” said indoor air expert Jeffrey Siegel of the University of Toronto. “If you have a long period of measurement in a space with a sensor that you know how to interpret, then it means something different than if you bring a sensor inside, read a few minutes of data, and say, ‘Oh, my God, the ventilation doesn’t work.’” A tiny greenhouse effect, in your hand When scientists want to measure carbon dioxide to a very high level of accuracy, they use sophisticated lab equipment. It can cost thousands of dollars. That is not what citizen activists are generally using during the pandemic. Rather, a variety of handheld or mountable sensors, costing about $100 and up, have become popular. Experts recommend devices that use a technology called non-dispersive infrared sensing (NDIR), a well-known technique based on the same basic physical principles that drive the so-called greenhouse effect. Whether in the atmosphere or a small chamber within your sensor, carbon dioxide absorbs a type of radiation with a wavelength longer than that of visible light, often dubbed infrared or heat radiation. At the scale of the Earth, greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide not only absorb this type of radiation but also re-emit it, keeping some of the heat within the planet’s system, rather than letting it escape to space. Within the far smaller sensor, infrared gets beamed from one side of a chamber to the other, and carbon dioxide concentrations are calculated based on how much radiation arrives at the other end without being absorbed by the gas. In theory, at least, such measurements can give a good sense of how many humans have been exhaling into a space, and how much their breath is lingering. “The reason CO2 measurements are important is that they can give an indication of how much air you are breathing that is coming out of other people’s respiratory systems,” says Richard Corsi, an indoor air quality expert at Portland State University who has been taking carbon dioxide measurements for years with many different instruments. A critical figure, Corsi says, is the “rebreathe fraction,” which refers to the percentage of the air you breathe in that others in the same indoor space recently breathed out. For instance, he has calculated that when the indoor concentration of carbon dioxide reaches 800 parts per million, then each time you breathe in, one percent of the air you inhale has come from the exhalations of others. During a pandemic, that’s an alarming thought. But carbon dioxide concentrations of 1,000, 2,000, or even 4,000 can be found in poorly ventilated indoor spaces, where people simply aren’t aware how much of the gas has built up. “Many teachers are reporting, they say they have 2,000, 5,000, and then curves of it going up in classes,” said Jose-Luis Jimenez, an aerosol science expert at the University of Colorado at Boulder who has promoted the use of the sensors and has been involved in testing a number of them for accuracy. It is very good news that the pandemic has raised our consciousness about the quality of air within buildings, a subject that has been neglected for decades, say longtime experts such as Corsi and the University of Toronto’s Siegel. And in their field, carbon dioxide has long been used as a proxy for how well ventilated a space is by outside air. But at the same time, these scientists worry that carbon dioxide measurements can be misinterpreted or even, in some cases, give a false sense of security. Siegel warns, for instance, that handheld devices can require calibration, can sometimes be confounded by other greenhouse gases (such as water vapor), and can drift in their measurements as time passes. That doesn’t make measurements useless, he said — but it does mean that you have to have some experience with your instrument, and should be measuring consistently over time. “The more engagement with indoor air, the better everything is,"" he said. ""But the problem is, good indoor air or bad indoor air is not defined by a spot measurement of CO2 with a low-cost sensor, without appropriate interpretation.” Corsi, meanwhile, cautions that even if very low or very high carbon dioxide concentrations may appear easy to interpret, many readings will fall into more of a gray area, somewhere between about 700 and 1000 parts per million. Are you safe in such a space? The answer is, it depends. For instance, Corsi notes, a space with 25 people in it and a CO2 measurement of 700 parts per million is far better ventilated than one with three people in it and the same measurement. Moreover, he adds, if a room has a portable HEPA air filter, or a good HVAC system with similarly strong filters (properly installed), then your risk will be lower even though carbon dioxide levels may seem a tad high. Carbon dioxide, a tiny molecule, passes right through these filters, even though the larger aerosols containing viruses can be caught by them. “I think a single-point measurement of CO2 can tell you something in the extremes, but when you get into this middle, typical area, there’s a lot of nuance,” Corsi said. Ideally, he thinks, there should be an app that would help people interpret CO2 levels by inputting other information, such as the number of people in a space and how much time they plan on spending there. Rekšņa, marketing director for the Aranet, says the device’s start-up guide tells users how to calibrate it, and after that it is accurate to within about 50 parts per million (which would certainly be enough to distinguish low concentrations from high ones). “We have dedicated technical support for the whole business ecosystem where we try to explain these things,” he said. “We have recently launched an Aranet forum as well. So we do try to inform the consumers as much as possible."" One more thing to keep in mind: Just as has happened with outdoor air all across the Earth, humans can fill the air indoors with carbon dioxide by burning wood or fossil fuels, such as in fireplaces and gas stoves. In these cases, concentrations can spike for reasons that have nothing to do with our breathing. In other words, CO2 measurements can be useful and informative, but have to be understood in context. ‘A risk proxy for covid’ Still, the baseline principle is hard to dispute: If carbon dioxide levels are very low in a business, or office, or grocery store, or wherever — then your coronavirus transmission risk is probably also low, at least from people who aren’t very close to you. (The risk will be lower still if people are also masked and wearing their masks properly.) What’s unfolding in Washington state right now may be a case study of how well — or how poorly — the technique can be employed through a concerted policy effort involving state regulators and individual businesses. “There’s been a number of studies that have used CO2 levels as kind of a risk proxy for covid,” said Sheri Sawyer, a policy adviser to the state’s governor, Inslee, who was centrally involved in issuing the new guidance on “open air” dining. The document is a joint product of the state’s health department and its Department of Labor and Industries. “And we thought that made great sense for businesses to use that as a tool for what their risk is for covid transmission.” ""It’s kind of uncharted territory,” Sawyer continued. “But certainly, given what businesses are going through, we think it’s a worthy endeavor to try to figure these answers out.” The new Washington state policy is one factor that is driving “a tremendous spike in demand for these products,” said Travis Lenander, the CEO of CO2Meter.com, which manufactures the devices used in Crandall’s restaurant. Indeed, Sawyer says the state is now receiving a large number of questions from businesses about how to use carbon dioxide monitors, and suggests that this is probably the beginning of a lengthy dialogue between the state and its restaurants and other venues. The state has just added an FAQ document to further help restaurants learn to use their monitors, adjust them when needed and set up spaces with good airflow. The large response so far is “a sign businesses are seeing this as a way they can open up,” she said. That’s certainly how Crandall, in Burlington, feels. “Everybody is trying to figure out how to open their doors, and spending all this money on heaters, and trying to figure out these CO2 detectors,” said Crandall, who has also installed one at his other business, the Train Wreck Bar & Grill. “You’ve got all these employees that you want to get hired back, and get your system up rolling again, and hopefully you can start paying your bills and get ahead again.”",The coronavirus is airborne. Here’s how to know if you’re breathing other people’s breath.
203,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/02/09/countries-must-ramp-up-climate-pledges-by-80-percent-hit-key-paris-target-study-finds/,WP,Towards Left,"The pledges countries made to reduce emissions as part of the 2015 Paris agreement are woefully inadequate, and the world must nearly double its greenhouse gas-cutting goals to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change, according to research published Tuesday. “The commitments are not enough,” said Adrian Raftery, a University of Washington statistics professor and co-author of the study, published in Communications Earth & Environment. The study found that even if countries were to meet their existing pledges, the world has only about a 5 percent chance to limit the Earth’s warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) over preindustrial levels — a key aim of the international agreement. Raftery and a colleague calculated that global emissions would need to fall steadily — about 1.8 percent each year on average — to put the world on a more sustainable trajectory. While no two countries are alike, that amounts to overall emissions reductions roughly 80 percent more ambitious than those pledged under the Paris agreement, he said. In many respects, the race to slow the Earth’s warming is a daunting math problem. Emissions have risen about 1.4 percent annually on average over the past decade, not including the abnormal plunge in 2020 driven by the coronavirus pandemic. In 2019, the world logged the highest emissions ever recorded, at 59 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, a category that includes not only carbon dioxide but also methane and other climate-warming agents. If that trend continues unabated, scientists say, the world could begin to cross troubling climate thresholds within the coming decade. The architects of the Paris accord and numerous world leaders have long underscored that the pledges made in 2015 were not enough to limit warming to acceptable levels. The expectation was always that nations would grow more ambitious with time, and there is evidence that is happening. But as global emissions have continued to rise, as countries have failed to hit even modest targets and as the consequences of a warming world have become more tangible, the push for leaders to act more aggressively has become only more urgent. ‘Tick tock’: U.N. climate talks end with fresh doubts over global unity   “Time is running out,” Niklas Höhne, a German climatologist and founding partner of NewClimate Institute, said in an interview. “The longer we wait, the more difficult it will be to turn emissions downward.” Höhne is also part of the team behind Climate Action Tracker, an effort that tracks what cuts countries have vowed to take and how they are, or aren’t, living up to those promises. He said that with the pledges countries have made, the world is currently on pace to reach 2.6 Celsius (4.7 Fahrenheit) of warming by the end of the century. But based on measures they have actually put into place, the figure is closer to 2.9 Celsius (5.2 Fahrenheit). At either level, scientists say humans would be forced to grapple with ever more extreme weather events, crippling heat waves and wildfires, and disastrous levels of flooding that could leave some coastal communities uninhabitable. The level of ambition necessary varies greatly between countries, Raftery said, noting that the United States would need to increase its existing goal by 38 percent to do its part toward achieving the 2C goal. The United Kingdom, which has already made progress on its promises, would need a boost of about 17 percent. Meanwhile, countries such as Brazil, which have seen emissions climb despite promises to scale them back, would need bolder action to make up for lost time. Kelly Levin, a senior associate at the World Resources Institute, noted that Tuesday’s study did not take into account more recent policies that some large countries have adopted or already begun to implement, and which could put the world on a more hopeful path. “Given the recent momentum we have seen — for example, from the Biden administration’s recent executive orders, to bans of the internal combustion engine in countries and by companies — their estimates, which are based on recent trends, are likely too conservative,” Levin said in an email. Still, she said, by any calculation there remains “a wide gulf between where emissions are headed today” and where they need to be to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The findings also echo those published late last year by the U.N. Environment Program, which said nations would need to “roughly triple” their current emissions-cutting pledges to limit the Earth’s warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius. To reach the loftier goal of holding warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), that report found, countries would need to increase their targets at least fivefold, a change that would require rapid and profound shifts in how societies travel, produce electricity and eat. A critical moment will arrive later this year when leaders from around the world assemble in Glasgow for a U.N. climate conference, which was delayed a year because of the pandemic. Presidents and prime ministers worldwide already are facing pressure to show up with more ambitious pledges in hand. Some of the world’s biggest economies have said they intend to do just that. China, the world’s largest emitter, has promised to reach zero net carbon emissions by 2060. The European Union has said that by the end of the decade, it intends to cut emissions “at least 55 percent” from 1990 levels. More than 125 countries, representing more than two-thirds of global emissions, have either adopted or are discussing a goal of reaching net zero emissions by the middle of the century, Höhne said. The United States, which is rejoining the Paris accord after President Donald Trump withdrew from it last year, has not yet formally submitted a new pledge. But President Biden has made clear that he will aim to put the world’s second-biggest emitter on a path to net zero emissions by 2050, while also decarbonizing the electricity sector by 2035. “President Biden knows that we have to mobilize in unprecedented ways to meet a challenge that is fast accelerating. And he knows we have limited time to get it under control,” U.S. climate envoy John F. Kerry told an online summit last month. How Joe Biden’s surprisingly ambitious climate plan came together U.N. Secretary General António Guterres has continued to press nations to go further and faster, as the world has already surpassed 1 degree Celsius of warming. “The drive for net-zero emissions must become the new normal for everyone, everywhere,” Guterres said in a speech Monday. “At the same time, all commitments to net zero must be underpinned by clear and credible plans to achieve them. Words are not enough.” Raftery said that while the findings of Tuesday’s study might initially seem discouraging, he sees glimmers of optimism. Major countries are promising bold action, markets are moving away from fossil fuels, businesses are paying attention to climate concerns and upcoming stimulus funding could prioritize greener investments. “I’m a bit surprised in a way to see it’s not as hopeless as I would have felt three years ago,” he said of the changes needed to alter the world’s trajectory. “It’s a heavy lift, but it’s not impossible.”","Countries must ramp up climate pledges by 80 percent to hit key Paris target, study finds"
204,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/02/06/auto-industry-peers-into-an-electric-future-sees-bumps-ahead/,WP,Towards Left,"Will Ferrell has it out for Norway. “Did you know that Norway sells way more electric cars per capita than the U.S.?” he asks before smashing his fist through a plastic globe. In an unlikely and very expensive Super Bowl ad made by the usually-staid General Motors, a disheveled, bearded Ferrell shouts “Well I won’t stand for it!” During a break in the Super Bowl action, the comedian vows to “crush” Norway and recruits help from Kenan Thompson of “Saturday Night Live” and actress and rapper Awkwafina in a multimillion-dollar promotion for GM’s Ultium battery. At the end, after Ferrell mistakenly winds up in Sweden and Thompson and Awkwafina mistakenly end up in Finland, the ad says “We’re coming, Norway.” Conquering Norway’s small car market won’t make or break the fate of GM, which has been making cars for more than a century. But the good-humored GM ad — one of two EV ads the company will air — is another sign that the world’s fourth-largest automobile company might be trying to steer its way toward a new era of electric vehicles. This week, GM’s corporate account tweeted, “Norway is crushing us at EVs. That’s crazy. We have to do better.” GM chief executive Mary Barra said in a tweet: “Norway has set the bar high with electric vehicle adoption.” And the company account tweeted again to say: “Did you know 54% of new cars sold in Norway are EVs? We can’t let them show us up.” It isn’t just GM. The global automobile business is peering into an all-electric future, the industry’s most profound turning point in a century and the most crucial since the 2009 financial crisis that saw GM go in and out of bankruptcy. After spending the past four years encouraging President Donald Trump to weaken fuel efficiency standards, GM’s Barra last week did a U-turn on electric vehicles, declaring that the company’s “aspiration” was to phase out gasoline vehicles and sell only electric versions of passenger cars and light trucks by 2035, eliminating tailpipe emissions. “The timing right now is excellent,” said Dane Parker, head of sustainability at GM, noting the Biden administration’s “clear emphasis on a low-carbon or zero-carbon future.” The industry knows more about how to make electric cars than American scientists knew about space travel before going to the moon, Parker said. “We will look back and say, ‘Wow, that worked.’” Other companies have already been speeding ahead. Ford Motor Co. on Thursday said it would double its outlays on EVs, adding about $11 billion in new spending through 2025; another $7 billion will go to driverless vehicles. Volkswagen is pumping $37 billion into a race to outdo all-electric Tesla. But there are many bumps in the road ahead. The carmaker of the future will have to be as much a battery or software company as it is a conventional engineering company. It will need networks of rapid recharging stations and massive new supply chains to meet demand for new parts, like lithium for batteries. New business models could alter the nature of car ownership — and undermine politically powerful dealers. And throughout, the big car companies must work to maintain peace with their unions. “Barriers will slow down the achievement of some of these goals,” said John Paul MacDuffie, professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, “but there will be a tipping point and all forward-looking forces will be focused on this future.” Even if the big car manufacturers can marry the expertise of Silicon Valley-style software and Detroit-style mass production, climate experts worry that the scale of the transportation sector is so great that overhauling it will take far too long from a climate perspective. GM’s Chevrolet Bolt sales in the United States doubled in the fourth quarter of 2020 from a year earlier, but they remained 0.8 percent of GM’s 2.5 million U.S. sales for the year. Globally, electric vehicles made up about 3 percent of total cars sold in 2020, according to the International Energy Agency. David R. Keith, a Chevy Bolt owner and assistant professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said “given that EVs cost more than conventional vehicles and we’re at a point where consumers are not making lavish discretionary purchases, the question is not, ‘Can we sell to the wealthy?’ It is, ‘Can we get the everyday household in mainstream America to buy an EV?’ and we’re still a long way away from that.” Meanwhile, he added, the cars on the road today will be on the road for the next 15 to 20 years. “There is so much inertia baked into those 250 million light-duty vehicles,” he said. The biggest companies, like GM, have not gotten off to a strong start. On at least three occasions, the batteries powering GM’s Chevy Bolt caught on fire under the rear passenger seat, according to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports. In one instance, a car recharging in a driveway in Belmont, Mass., caught fire, billowing smoke, forcing the evacuation of neighbors and leaving behind noxious fumes through the house; it took firefighters three hours to extinguish the blaze. In Vienna, Va., it took firefighters an hour to douse a burning Bolt outside a townhouse — and they had to be called two more times when the car started smoking again. In November, GM issued a recall for 50,932 Chevy Bolts — more than 60 percent of all Chevy Bolts on the road. The company urged its customers to park their cars outdoors a safe distance from their houses, an inconvenience for EV owners who rely on recharging sockets inside their garages. And GM adjusted the Bolt batteries so that they couldn’t recharge more than 90 percent of capacity. “It’s really a city car,” said MIT’s Keith. GM’s early struggles are cultural as much as they are technological. In November, GM launched a hiring blitz for 3,000 engineering, design and information technology specialists. “This will clearly show that we’re committed to further developing the software we need to lead in EVs, enhance the customer experience and become a software expertise-driven workforce,” GM President Mark Reuss said in a news release. But on the online job site Glassdoor, many GM workers in software were disappointed. One current GM employee said there were “good benefits” and a “good work/life balance,” but “too much time spent on meetings and political games.” The advice to management? “It is hopeless. IT management needs to be completely replaced. IT bureaucracy is an obstacle for innovation.” A former employee said the pros of working there included “working with the latest on Car Tech.” The cons? “Big company, slow pace of changes.” Glassdoor does not post the names or contact information of people who correspond on its site. VW has also struggled with software glitches, which forced the German carmaker to twice postpone sales of its new ID.3, which resembles the Golf. The big carmakers have to compete for talented engineers, not only with Tesla but with other new entrants into the car market. One 11-year-old EV startup, Rivian, last year swiped a rising star named Alex Archer from GM’s design engineering department. Archer, a 2015 Stanford University graduate, had already invented a sliding console in 2020 models of GM’s small trucks and SUVs. Rivian said this week that the first of 10,000 vans Amazon had ordered by 2022 would start making deliveries in select cities. Rivian also plans to start selling pickup trucks later this year, a direct competitor with some of the industry’s most popular brands. Amazon has invested $700 million and Ford has invested $500 million in Rivian. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post). For workers who lack Archer’s star power, the coming upheaval in the car markets is a source of anxiety. Unions are worried that the change to electric vehicles might undermine their membership. EV powertrains are mechanically simpler than those in internal combustion engines, the United Auto Workers said in a report. According to analysts at UBS, the Chevy Bolt’s e-motor has three moving parts, while a VW Golf’s internal combustion engine has 113. “This simplicity could reduce the amount of labor, and thus jobs, associated with vehicle production,” the UAW report said. But while electric vehicles lack transmissions, exhaust systems and fuel systems, they could create employment in batteries, electric motors, electronics, thermal systems, braking systems, and semiconductors. The problem, the union warned, is that many of those new components “could shift business and employment to non-auto companies that lack a large U.S. manufacturing base. This could undermine auto job quality by shifting work to employers with a poor history of labor relations or companies that are more likely to import components.” The big carmakers also face a variety of battery challenges, posing tough questions for President Biden on trade, subsidies and investment. In her confirmation hearing, energy secretary nominee Jennifer Granholm noted that “of the 142 lithium ion battery mega-factories that are under construction, 107 are in China. Nine are in the U.S. We can’t sustain this. We have got to lean in much more quickly.” That’s going to mean subsidizing domestic battery makers or arm-twisting or incentivizing foreign battery makers to set up factories in the United States. The UAW has called for large-scale retraining programs for displaced workers. An explosion in the use of electric batteries could also spark conflict over environmental choices, pitting conservation against industrial needs. James D. Calaway, chairman of an Australian firm called Ioneer, is hoping to get the permits to start a lithium mine in Nevada that would quadruple U.S. production of the mineral. It would be located on the parched outcropping Rhyolite Ridge in the third-most-sparsely populated county in the United States, Calaway says, between Reno and Las Vegas. Phase one would produce about 22,000 tons a year of battery-grade lithium for the next 25 years — enough to produce about 400,000 EVs a year. The U.S. market usually exceeds 17 million cars a year, though with the ailing economy, sales fell about 15 percent short of that last year. But getting that lithium would mean destroying much of the habitat of Tiehm’s buckwheat, a plant, says the Center for Biological Diversity, which wants to stop the mine. Tracking Biden’s environmental actions; The new president is unwinding Trump’s legacy while forging his own “What we need is sensible environmental policy,” Calaway said. “We have got to weigh this against our targets on CO2.” The nascent electric vehicle market could soon be riled further by a spat between two South Korean battery makers arguing over intellectual property. One company, SK Group, is sinking about $2.6 billion into a massive battery plant in a rural town in Georgia, the largest foreign investment in the state’s history. But LG Chem says SK stole its intellectual property and has asked the International Trade Commission to block SK from starting up the plant. That would hurt SK’s two biggest customers, Ford, which wants to put the batteries in an electric version of the popular F-150 pickup, and VW, which wants to use them in a car plant in Chattanooga, Tenn. “If somehow this plant were to be rendered unusable because of this ITC decision, it isn’t like they go out and put Duracell batteries in this thing. You need to design customized batteries,” said Daniel Spiegel, vice chair of the public policy practice at the law firm Covington & Burling, which is representing SK. If the ITC sides with LG Chem, Biden could overturn that decision. There are only five other occasions when a president has overruled the ITC. The last was President Barack Obama in a dispute between Apple and Samsung. Either way, the case shows how vulnerable the EV supply chain is to disruption. “This goes right into the wheelhouse of Biden’s jobs plan, Biden’s global warming plan, Biden’s advanced technology plan, Biden’s manufacturing in the United States plan,” Spiegel said. “All these things are embedded in this trade agency’s decision next week.” And then there are the auto dealers, who in most states are shielded from manufacturers by consumer protection laws. Many dealers make more money on follow-up services and leasing than they do selling cars in the first place. They have little to no expertise in batteries or EV software. When Tesla announced it would have virtually no showrooms and would sell directly to customers, dealers were up in arms. “An EV well engineered is going to have a much lower service profile than an internal combustion engine,” said Diarmuid O’Connell, a former top Tesla executive. “The question is what is the strategic business model for dealers to be incentivized to support EVs.” Another ad that was to be aired during the Super Bowl takes aim at car dealers, portraying one as a villain who has tied up a potential customer on the floor and threatens him with jumper cables in a horror-like sequence that ends with a sunny pitch for Vroom, an online car dealership that delivers vehicles to the home. Many dealers are simply closing shop. Given a choice, 17 percent of 880 Cadillac dealers took a buyout from GM rather than invest in the repair equipment and charging stations needed to sell and service electric versions of the luxury car, the Wall Street Journal reported. When O’Connell worked at Tesla, he was tasked with overcoming the dealers’ demands. “It was a painful experience to have to go state to state, dealing with folks who were locally very politically connected. And very often there was, if not an explicit, an implicit monopoly,” he said. O’Connell said the auto industry every year for three or four years invited him to a summertime conference in Traverse City, Mich., to debate the future of EVs. And every year, auto industry executives would say that motorists aren’t interested in them. O’Connell would reply, “You’re not even trying.” For now, the big century-old companies are sprucing up existing brands. Ford, in addition to introducing electric F-150 pickups, will start selling an electric version of its Mustang. GM is pressing ahead with plans for a new electric Cadillac crossover called the Lyriq. So far, though, the road to an EV future looks like a long one. “Kenan, Norway’s out-EV’ing us,” Ferrell says in the Super Bowl ad. “Grab an EV, meet me in Norway.” Ferrell then interrupts Awkwafina, who is practicing archery outside her house. “Sorry to disturb you, but Norway’s beating us in EVs,” he says, catching an arrow in his teeth. “Meet me there in an hour.” Perhaps the auto industry will have a better sense of direction than Ferrell and his fellow stars.",Auto industry peers into an electric future and sees bumps ahead
205,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/02/03/epa-regan-hearing/,WP,Towards Left,"Michael Regan, President Biden’s choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, told lawmakers Wednesday that he would “restore” science and transparency at the agency, focus on marginalized communities and move “with a sense of urgency” to combat climate change. Facing a Senate panel where half of the members are Republicans wary of the EPA’s authority and its reach into much of American life, Regan appealed to a collective sense of duty. “We all have a stake in the health of our environment, the strength of our economy, the well-being of our communities and the legacy we will leave the next generation in the form of our nation’s natural resources,” he told members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The 44-year-old Regan, who began his career at the EPA more than two decades ago and currently heads the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, appeared likely to win confirmation after a three-hour hearing in which he received a universally warm reception. Some Republicans, however, confronted him about the Biden administration’s plans to aggressively limit emissions from the nation’s automotive and fossil fuel sectors, insisting that moving too quickly risks worsening an already battered economy. “Right now they look like they are putting forward a strategy that will crush jobs [and] lower the amount of energy we can produce,” Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), said of Biden’s early moves to kill the Keystone XL pipeline and halt oil and gas drilling on public lands. “It’s a policy that makes no sense.” Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo) likened the administration’s actions to “delivering pink slips to hard-working men and women in Wyoming and across the country.” Regan countered that, like Biden, he believes the United States will benefit from embracing the inevitable transition away from fossil fuels and that millions of jobs can come from investing in the shift toward a green economy. “We all understand the anxiety and the fear as we make this transition that folks in your states have,” he said. “What I know is we’ve been instructed that we are not to leave any community behind. In order for us to be successful, every state and every community has to see itself in our vision.” If confirmed, Regan would become the first Black man to lead the EPA in its half-century of existence, working in an administration that has pledged to address the unequal burden of pollution carried by communities of color. He also would step into a high-profile job with a pair of daunting missions: to reverse the aggressive dismantling of environmental safeguards during the Trump years, and to play a central role in translating Biden’s promise to combat climate change into real-world policies. Tracking Biden’s environmental actions Over the past four years, the Trump administration took aim at more than 200 environmental protections and rules, according to a Washington Post analysis. The EPA shrank by hundreds of employees as President Donald Trump played down the science around climate change and acted to bolster the fossil fuel industry. Biden has made climate change a pillar of his administration. He rejoined the Paris climate accord and began the process overturning scores of environmental actions taken by Trump. But even as the White House moves decisively and activists clamor for even more far-reaching efforts, Regan positioned himself Wednesday as more a consensus seeker than a crusader. “I’ve learned that if you want to address complex challenges, you must first be able to see them from all sides, and you must be willing to put yourself in other people’s shoes,” Regan said, adding that “we can’t simply regulate ourselves out of every problem we face."" It’s an approach that won Regan respect across party lines in North Carolina — and also criticism from environmentalists who wanted him to act more aggressively — as secretary of the state’s Department of Environmental Quality since 2017. During his tenure, he settled a multibillion-dollar cleanup of coal waste storage facilities with Duke Energy, established an environmental justice advisory board and reached across the political divide to work with the state’s Republican legislature. With historic picks, Biden puts environmental justice front and center In another high-profile environmental case, the state ordered the chemical company Chemours to virtually eliminate per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a group of human-made chemicals, from seeping into the Cape Fear River. The chemicals — used in cookware, stain repellent and other products — have been linked to harmful health effects, including low infant birth weights and thyroid hormone disruption. Regan, who graduated from North Carolina A&T State University and earned a master’s at George Washington University, also advised Gov. Roy Cooper (D) on the state’s plans to mitigate climate change. He frustrated some activists who said he could have been tougher on polluting industries, even as they describe him as honest and well-intentioned. Even so, environmental groups have rallied around Regan’s nomination, arguing that he has the right background and skills to pursue meaningful action to cut the nation’s emissions, grow clean energy jobs and help communities that historically have suffered the most from pollution. Regan arrived at the EPA in the late 1990s and served for more than a decade under both the Clinton and Bush administrations. He returned to North Carolina as southeast regional director for the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group, where he focused on lessening the impacts of climate change on the region and on improving air quality in polluted communities. But Regan testified that it was during his childhood in eastern North Carolina — where he grew up hunting and fishing with his father and grandfather but also suffered from asthma in an area with a legacy of toxic pollution — that he understood environmental protection. “Preserving our natural resources isn’t something to balance with economic growth,” he said. “It’s one of the keys to economic growth, along with protecting public health and our way of life.” On Wednesday, two of the Democrat’s strongest endorsements came from his state’s Republican senators. Sen. Richard Burr called Regan “a good man” and “extremely qualified” to lead the EPA. Sen. Thom Tillis added that he and other Republicans are certain to disagree with the environmental policies of the Biden White House. “But what we can hope for is people in the administration who have a track record of listening,” he said, adding about Regan: “He will be fair. He will listen.""",Biden’s EPA nominee vows ‘urgency’ on climate change
206,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2021/02/03/climate-empire-state-wind/,WP,Towards Left,"The world got a little bit greener when the lights of the Empire State Building flickered to life this year: For the first time, the beloved skyscraper and 13 other office buildings owned by the same company were powered solely by wind. Empire State Realty Trust will announce Wednesday a major purchase of wind power from Green Mountain Energy and Direct Energy, making it the nation’s biggest real estate user of entirely renewable energy. The three-year contracts, which started Jan. 1, will provide an estimated 300 million kilowatt hours of electricity for ESRT’s more than 10 million-square-foot portfolio. That’s enough to light every home in New York state for a month. The real estate trust has already established a reputation for sustainability: A decade-long “deep carbon” retrofit enabled the Empire State Building to cut its planet-warming emissions by about 40 percent. The skyscraper itself has run on renewable energy since 2011. How New York's most famous landmark cut its carbon emissions by 40 percent By expanding its renewable energy commitments to its entire portfolio, ESRT will avoid the production of some 450 million pounds of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of removing all New York City taxis from the road for an entire year. The energy needed to operate buildings is among the nation’s largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. In New York, buildings generate more than two-thirds of the city’s carbon emissions. “More and more building owners are understanding the critical role that our skyline plays in tackling climate change and how they can be an important part of the solution,” said Donna De Costanzo, a director for climate and clean energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council. After the Empire State Building’s “nation-leading retrofit,” she said, the decision to meet its remaining energy needs with renewables is “a significant next step.” Citing confidentiality clauses in its contracts, ESRT declined to give the dollar value of the renewable energy purchase. The company noted that buying clean energy is slightly more costly than simply buying power from local utilities. But opting for renewable power was as much a business decision as an environmental one, said Anthony Malkin, the trust’s chief executive. Many of ESRT’s existing tenants had been asking about switching to greener energy sources. And a growing number of companies — including some that rent space in ESRT buildings — have adopted corporate sustainability initiatives that include commitments to reduce their carbon footprints. “We want to differentiate ourselves so we get better tenants at higher rents so we can outperform our competition,” Malkin said. “It’s all market driven.” This move is an important symbolic victory for renewables, said Cyndy Reynolds, commercial sales director for Green Mountain Energy. “When you have someone like ESRT who you know is going to look at every facet, whether it’s cost or reliability, and they decide to move forward … it’s not just a PR play at that point,” Reynolds said. “It truly does check the boxes of all the business metrics they have.” “It’s so important to have examples like ESRT to show the nation that renewable power options are affordable and, dare I say, competitive,” she said. The realities of the U.S. electric grid mean that the electrons powering ESRT’s lights and elevators don’t necessarily come directly from renewable sources. Green Mountain Energy sells power from certified wind farms around the country. Purchases of renewables through Direct Energy go toward solar and wind facilities in Texas. This is how it works for almost all purchasers of green energy: Unless you are drawing power directly from solar panels or wind turbines on your own property, buying renewable energy simply means that you are paying for that energy to be produced somewhere. With the new contracts, a kilowatt hour of clean energy will be added to the grid for every kilowatt hour of electricity that ESRT properties use — helping to shift the nation away from carbon-emitting fossil fuels. “If we increase the demand for clean power, we will necessarily decrease the demand for polluting power,” Malkin said. “And if we decrease the demand for polluting power, that stuff will come off the grid.” Wind is the most-used renewable energy source in the United States, according to the Energy Information Administration, generating about 9 percent of the nation’s electricity last year. Data from the financial advisory company Lazard show that new wind power facilities are cheaper to build and operate than almost all kinds of fossil fuel infrastructure, even without government subsidies. If you factor in tax credits and other incentives, generating wind can cost as little as $9 per 1,000 kilowatt-hours, compared to at least $23 per kilowatt-hour at natural gas power plants. The vast majority of electricity in New York state currently comes from natural gas-fired and nuclear power plants. But in 2019, the state passed legislation committing to meet 70 percent of its energy needs with renewable sources by the end of the decade. New York aims to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from its electric grid by 2040. Big businesses have an important role to play in promoting that transition, Malkin said. By committing to buy renewable energy, ESRT is signaling to investors that there’s money to be made in taking action on climate. “We’re trying to move the market with capital, rather than through a policy mandate,” he said. “There’s nothing wrong with a policy mandate. But if you can motivate people through business decisions, that’s good too. It’s another lever.”",The Empire State Building and its related buildings are now powered by wind
207,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/02/01/trump-secret-science/,WP,Towards Left,"A federal judge on Monday vacated the Trump administration rule limiting which scientific studies the Environmental Protection Agency can use in crafting public health protections, overturning one of the last major actions taken by the agency before President Biden took office. The ruling by Judge Brian Morris, chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana, Great Falls, marked a victory for environmental groups and public health advocates. Just two weeks before Biden’s inauguration, EPA finalized a rule requiring researchers to disclose the raw data involved in their public health studies before the agency could rely upon their conclusions. The rule, which was made effective immediately, would assign less weight to studies built on medical histories and other confidential data from human subjects where the underlying information was not revealed. That sort of research — including dose-response studies, which evaluate how much a person’s exposure to a substance increases the risk of harm — have been used for decades to justify EPA regulations. Trump officials, including then-EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler, argued that the new rule would provide the public with greater insight into the scientific basis for new regulations. But critics argued that the Trump administration aimed to impede or block access to the best available science, weakening the government’s ability to create new protections against pollution, pesticides, and possibly even the coronavirus. Three groups - the Environmental Defense Fund, the Montana Environmental Information Center and Citizens for Clean Energy - sued and last week Morris ruled the agency acted improperly by issuing the rule under the Federal Housekeeping Statute, which allows for changes that are only procedural and not substantive. The Biden administration requested the judge vacate the rule and send it back to the agency. The Biden administration is “pleased” with the ruling, said EPA spokeswoman Lindsay Hamilton, adding, “EPA is committed to making evidence-based decisions and developing policies and programs that are guided by the best science.” Tracking the dismantling of Trump's environmental legacy Monday’s court decision, coming less than two weeks after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down the 2019 rule that eased restrictions on power plants’ carbon emissions, will make it easier for the new administration to unwind Trump-era environmental policies. Environmental Defense Fund senior attorney Ben Levitan, whose group also challenged the emissions rule, said that the recent rulings “just reinforced the fundamental unlawfulness of Trump.” “It’s a hopeful sign that our environmental laws have survived the Trump administration,” he added. “There’s a real opportunity to implement the laws Congress passed and protect Americans from health and environmental harms.” Mandy Gunasekara, who was Wheeler’s chief of staff, said she hoped Biden officials would build off the Trump administration’s work even if they disagreed with its methods. “The decision is unfortunate but does not change the goal of the science transparency rule, which I would urge the new administration to support: Enhance the public trust in agency actions and improve regulatory outcomes,” she said. Darren Bakst, senior research fellow in agricultural policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said in an interview that the rule did not bar studies outright if they didn’t release their data, but “would provide less weight” to them. Even that provision, he noted, could be waived by the administrator on a case-by-case basis. “It is a very narrow situation when there are confidentiality concerns,” he said, adding the rule aimed to strengthen the public’s faith in the agency’s work. “You don’t know something’s the best available science until you see what goes into that.” In one of his final interviews before stepping down, Wheeler faulted environmental groups for rushing to challenge his agency’s work in court. “I have no problem with someone suing me if they take the time to read it and understand what the regulation does,” he said last month. “The environmental groups have a terrible record of knee-jerk reactions.”",Judge throws out Trump rule limiting what science EPA can use

Crutzen, a Nobel-winning chemist who revealed threats to the ozone layer, developed the concept of “nuclear winter” and concluded that humans were having such a profound impact on the planet that it was time to recognize a new geological epoch — the Anthropocene — died Jan. 28 at a hospital in Mainz, Germany. He was 87. His death was announced by the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, where Dr. Crutzen directed the atmospheric chemistry department from 1980 until retiring in 2000. A spokeswoman for the institute, Susanne Benner, said he “suffered from several years of illness” but did not specify the cause. Dr. Crutzen was raised in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands and initially worked as an engineer, not a scientist. Though he dreamed of an academic career, he enrolled at a technical school to spare his parents the cost of a university education and built bridges in Amsterdam before starting a new life for himself in Sweden. When he spotted a newspaper ad for a computer programming job at Stockholm College, he saw an opportunity. Despite lacking any experience, he applied for the position and got the job — and was soon sitting in on college classes, accumulating enough credits to get a master’s degree and apply for a doctorate program in meteorology. Dr. Crutzen went on to spend decades investigating the interplay between humans and the atmosphere, studying the causes of air pollution, the impact of wildfires, the consequences of nuclear war and the depletion of the ozone layer, which earned him a share of the 1995 Nobel Prize in chemistry. For all his accomplishments, he was perhaps best known in recent years for popularizing “the Anthropocene,” a poetic new term that he first used in 2000. “I was at a conference where someone said something about the Holocene, the long period of relatively stable climate since the end of the last ice age,” he told Fred Pearce, author of the climate change book “With Speed and Violence” (2007). “I suddenly thought that this was wrong. The world has changed too much. So I said: ‘No, we are in the Anthropocene.’ I just made up the word on the spur of the moment. Everyone was shocked.” He later learned that he was not the first to use the term “Anthropocene,” which biologist Eugene F. Stoermer had employed in the 1980s. Nor was he the first to offer a name for this human-dominated epoch of shrinking forests, rising temperatures and soaring population, which journalist Andrew Revkin once suggested calling the Anthrocene. But Dr. Crutzen’s proposal, formalized in a 2002 Nature article titled “Geology of Mankind,” quickly took off, spurring an ongoing debate over whether it is time to rewrite geology textbooks and add a new epoch to the planet’s timetable, one that emphasizes the powerful role that humans play in shaping the Earth. “Paul was very good at launching ideas that resonate with a lot of people, and that start to become a central theme of something,” said Guy Brasseur, a distinguished scholar at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. In a phone interview, he called Dr. Crutzen a master of developing “simple ideas, simple models, that show the essence of a process.” Dr. Crutzen was initially known for his work on the ozone layer, the thin atmospheric shield that protects plants and animals from ultraviolet radiation. In 1970, he demonstrated that compounds known as nitrogen oxides — spewed out by microbes in the soil — play a central role in controlling the level of ozone in the stratosphere. His discovery marked a fundamental breakthrough in understanding the chemistry of the ozone layer and shook up the debate over manufacturing supersonic transport planes such as the Concorde. Drawing on Dr. Crutzen’s research, some scientists feared that fleets of supersonic aircraft would pose a threat to the ozone layer by releasing nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere. (The transport planes were never built in large numbers.) Inspired by his research, chemists Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland published a 1974 article that identified a threat to the ozone layer from chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which were used in everything from air conditioners and refrigerators to hair spray and deodorant. British researchers later discovered a vast “ozone hole” over the South Pole, which Dr. Crutzen and other scientists linked to the CFCs. Their findings paved the way for the Montreal Protocol, a landmark 1987 treaty that phased out the use of ozone-destroying gases. In awarding the Nobel Prize to Dr. Crutzen, Rowland and Molina, who died in October, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said that “the three researchers have contributed to our salvation from a global environmental problem that could have catastrophic consequences.” The loss of the ozone was far from the only environmental catastrophe that Dr. Crutzen studied. In a 1982 article memorably subtitled “Twilight at Noon,” he and chemist John Birks warned of a climate disaster caused by a nuclear war, in which fires rage through cities, forests and oil fields. The resulting smoke would blot out the sun, they concluded, cooling the surface of the planet and jeopardizing agricultural production. Their theory gained further traction when five others, including astronomer Carl Sagan, co-authored a 1983 Science paper titled “Nuclear Winter.” Sagan later discussed the concept on television and campaigned against nuclear weapons, along with researchers such as Dr. Crutzen. “Although I do not count the ‘nuclear winter’ idea among my greatest scientific achievements . . . I am convinced that, from a political point of view, it is by far the most important,” Dr. Crutzen said in his Nobel Prize lecture. The theory, he added, “magnifies and highlights the dangers of a nuclear war and convinces me that in the long run mankind can only escape such horrific consequences if nuclear weapons are totally abolished by international agreement.” Paul Jozef Crutzen was born in Amsterdam on Dec. 3, 1933. His mother worked in a hospital kitchen, and his father waited tables but was often unemployed. The family later struggled to find food and fuel during the German occupation, amid a nationwide famine that became known as the “hunger winter.” Several of Dr. Crutzen’s classmates died before the Swedish Red Cross began dropping packages of food by parachute, and nearly all his classmates lost a year of schooling because they had only a few hours of instruction each week. With special help from a teacher, Dr. Crutzen carried on. In his telling, he excelled in math and physics but, “because of a heavy fever,” struggled in his high school final exam. His grades kept him from receiving a university stipend, setting him on a path to join the Amsterdam bridge construction bureau. In 1958 he married Terttu Soininen, a Finn, and moved to northern Sweden. He joined the meteorology department at Stockholm College (now a university) the next year and soon learned machine code that he used to program weather prediction models. He received a master’s degree in 1963, a PhD in 1968 and a doctor of science degree in 1973. Dr. Crutzen was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Oxford and worked at the National Center for Atmospheric Research before joining the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, where he mentored younger researchers such as Birks, his collaborator on the “nuclear winter” paper. “Paul Crutzen mentored at least hundreds and promoted the careers of thousands of scientists around the world,” Birks said in an email. “Besides being a brilliant scientist, he [is] one of the most caring and generous people I have ever known.” Survivors include his wife, two daughters and three grandchildren. Long after he helped keep pollutants out of the atmosphere through his ozone research, Dr. Crutzen made a bold proposal to flood the air with sulfur in an effort to combat global warming. Such “geoengineering” efforts were worth further study, Dr. Crutzen argued, especially if humanity did not act quickly to stem emissions and alter consumption habits. “Imagine our descendants in the year 2200 or 2500. They might liken us to aliens who have treated the Earth as if it were a mere stopover for refueling, or even worse, characterize us as barbarians who would ransack their own home,” he wrote in a 2011 essay with journalist Christian Schwägerl. “Living up to the Anthropocene means building a culture that grows with Earth’s biological wealth instead of depleting it. Remember, in this new era, nature is us.”

209,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/28/trump-blm-reorganization/,WP,Towards Left,"The Trump administration’s decision to relocate most Bureau of Land Management headquarters staffers out West — a move designed to shift power away from the nation’s capital — prompted more than 87 percent of the affected employees either to resign or retire rather than move, according to new data obtained by The Washington Post. The exit of longtime career staffers from the agency responsible for managing more than 10 percent of the nation’s land shows the extent to which the Trump administration reshaped the federal government. The reorganization plan reestablished the bureau’s headquarters in Grand Junction, Colo., moved 328 positions out of the main D.C. office of the Department of the Interior — BLM’s parent agency — and left 60 jobs in place. A total of 287 BLM employees either retired or found other jobs, according to Interior communications director Melissa Schwartz, while 41 people moved to the new office in Colorado. Asked for comment on how the shift affected the bureau’s operations, Schwartz declined to comment. But several experts, including former high-ranking Interior officials, said the shake-up has deprived the agency of needed expertise and disrupted its operations. The bureau oversees all oil and gas drilling on federal lands, which has emerged as a flash point in the early days of the Biden administration. Joe Tague, a 42-year BLM employee who retired as chief of its division of forest, rangeland, riparian and plant conservation a year ago, said in a phone interview that at least half of his division’s staff left rather than move. He retired “in part” because of the reorganization. “It wasn’t a pleasant thing, seeing everyone forced to move,” said Tague, who moved to Oregon. Tague, a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, said he was particularly worried about the agency’s diversity in the wake of the exodus because a disproportionately large number of Black employees had left. He added that some divisions, such as the one that oversees land-use plans, were hit particularly hard. “I think it’s going to take a long time to regain what the Washington office does,” he said. How President Biden is unraveling Trump's environmental legacy About 95 percent of the BLM’s more than 9,000 staffers were working outside of Washington before the relocation took place. The Trump administration argued that it made sense to place more of the agency’s workforce in the West because most of the areas it manages are there. Congressional Republicans are lobbying to maintain the new headquarters in Grand Junction. The Trump administration shifted 76 positions out of headquarters altogether, so there are now a total of 480 headquarters jobs, 100 of which remain vacant. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) said this week she was leading a campaign to keep the bureau in the city she represents. “Moving the BLM Headquarters to Grand Junction was a game changer for the West and local communities. People from nearby states that would have never traveled to Washington D.C. for a meeting have already found their way to Grand Junction including sheriffs, ranchers, and county commissioners,” Boebert said in a statement. “What’s not to like?” And the state’s two senators, Michael F. Bennet and John Hickenlooper, both Democrats, support the idea of having an expanded BLM headquarters in Colorado. The two wrote to Biden last week saying they support a “fully functioning” Colorado headquarters with hundreds of employees instead of the current setup. “The BLM assigned only 41 senior staff positions to relocate to Grand Junction, positions that they had to rush to fill at the end of 2020,” the senators wrote. “While this is a reasonable start and is appreciated by the Western Slope, the job is far from finished.” But Steve Ellis, the president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said in an interview that the BLM staffers working at Interior headquarters play a crucial role in coordinating policy. “They’re going to have the national perspective and will be able to tie in the regional offices into the overall policy and know historically what the agency’s role is,” Ellis said. “And they also would be working with other agencies, both within the Interior Department and throughout the federal government.”",Trump officials moved most Bureau of Land Management positions out of D.C. More than 87 percent quit instead.
210,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2021/01/28/biden-federal-fleet-electric/,WP,Towards Left,"There are some 645,000 vehicles in the federal fleet. They include roughly 200,000 passenger vehicles, 78,517 heavy-duty trucks, 47,369 vans, 847 ambulances and three limousines. Each year, federal vehicles are driven about 4.5 billion miles, using almost 400 million gallons of gasoline and spewing more than 7 billion pounds of planet-warming greenhouse gases. Now President Biden wants to turn the entire fleet green. In an executive order signed Wednesday, Biden directed federal officials to devise a plan for converting all federal, state, local and tribal fleets, including 225,000 Postal Service vehicles, to “clean and zero-emission vehicles.” The declaration is a boon to the fledgling electric vehicle industry, which has grown exponentially in the past decade but still represents fewer than 2 percent of automobiles sold in the United States. And it represents yet another aspect of Biden’s “all government” approach to fighting climate change; using the power of the purse, he aims to help boost American manufacturers of green products. “It’s important as a symbolic thing,” said Timothy Lipman, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California at Berkeley. “But I think it also will have a way of helping to jolt the industry forward at a time when it kind of needed that.” As of 2019, just 4,475 government-owned vehicles were electric, according to data from the General Services Administration. According to Biden’s order, officials will have 90 days to put together their plan for electrifying the rest of the fleet. It’s not yet clear what the timeline will be for eliminating combustion engine vehicles. In the meantime, there are plenty of questions about how the government will achieve this transformation. One of the biggest issues: Just three automakers currently manufacture electric vehicles in the United States, and none of those cars meet Biden’s criteria of being produced by union workers from at least 50 percent American-made materials. The closest is the Chevrolet Bolt, assembled at a General Motors plant in Lake Orion, Mich. But most of that car’s parts — including the battery, motor and drive unit — are produced overseas. But that could easily change, said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the nonprofit Center for Automotive Research. If Biden succeeds in making every car in the federal fleet electric, he would increase the total number of electric vehicles in the United States by more than 50 percent. “One of the big questions for companies is, ‘Is the consumer there?’ Well, [the government] is a big consumer,” Dziczek said. “Now they know there’s some solid demand from the government to support their early launches of new vehicles.” Just a day after Biden’s executive order, General Motors said it would end the sale of all gas- and diesel-powered passenger cars and light sports utility vehicles by 2035, with an aim of becoming carbon-neutral by 2040. With 640,000 nonelectric vehicles, the federal fleet represents the annual output of about three or four automotive plants, Dziczek said. That’s not exactly the million jobs Biden promised in his announcement Monday. But it might be sufficient to persuade car manufacturers to change their supply chains or shift their production to U.S. facilities. Dziczek was less optimistic that Biden’s order would make manufacturers more supportive of unionization efforts at their plants. A spokeswoman for Nissan, which produces the battery-powered Leaf in Smyrna, Tenn., said the company is not currently a federal contractor but is open to new opportunities. Representatives for Chevrolet and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, United Auto Workers president Rory L. Gamble said the union planned to work with the Biden administration on shifting away from combustion engines. In a recent white paper, UAW noted that electric drive trains require less labor to build, and the transition to electric vehicles could put some auto employees out of work. The union has called for manufacturers and policymakers to retool plants and retrain displaced workers for different jobs producing batteries, advanced braking systems, electronics and other components. Even before Biden’s announcement, automakers had plans to produce 99 different models of electric vehicle in North America (currently there are 24). Global electrical vehicle sales grew in 2020 even while the rest of the car market suffered from the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Once accessible only to the wealthy and ecologically minded, electric vehicles now boast sticker prices similar to their gas-powered counterparts. Since electric engines don’t requires as much maintenance, these cars are actually less expensive to own in the long run. Given the current demand for electric cars, the International Energy Administration projects that the global number of battery-powered and hybrid vehicles could increase from just over 5 million to nearly 140 million by 2030. But if nations increase their invest in charging infrastructure and provide additional incentives, that number could be closer to 240 million — making about one-third of all cars on the road electric. “For an industry that is just starting to achieve liftoff,” said Lipman, Biden’s commitment to buying electric vehicles “puts more wind in its sails.”",Biden wants an all-electric federal fleet. The question is: How will he achieve it?
211,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/28/general-motors-electric/,WP,Towards Left,"General Motors has pledged to stop making gasoline-powered passenger cars, vans and sport utility vehicles by 2035, marking a historic turning point for the iconic American carmaker and promising a future of new electric vehicles for American motorists. GM chief executive Mary Barra, who antagonized many climate experts by embracing President Donald Trump’s relaxation of fuel efficiency targets, said Thursday the company now wants to lead the way to a greener future. “As one of the world’s largest automakers, we hope to set an example of responsible leadership in a world that is faced with climate change,” Barra said on LinkedIn. GM has said it would invest $27 billion in electric vehicles and associated products between 2020 and 2025, outstripping its spending on conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles. That figure includes refurbishing factories and investing in battery production in conjunction with LG Chem, a South Korean battery maker. As part of its plan, GM — maker of Buicks, Cadillacs, Chevrolets and Corvettes, among others — will manufacture about 30 types of electric vehicles. By late 2025, about 40 percent of the company’s U.S. models will be battery-powered electric vehicles, it said. And it pledged to make its factories and other facilities carbon neutral by 2040. One of the Big Three automakers that dominated the North American car market for decades, GM has rolled out millions of pollution-spewing cars and trucks. Transportation accounts for about 28 percent of total U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions, making it the largest contributor of the pollution that is driving climate change. GM now faces the task of reorienting and revamping supply chains, assembly lines and its labor force to produce a new kind of product that few Americans have experienced. “This is a very significant pivot … especially for such an iconic American institution,” said Barry Rabe, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. For a century, GM has been a giant of American carmaking and of the Michigan economy. In Rabe’s corner of southeastern Michigan, where tens of thousands of people are employed by the auto industry, “the central part of life has been the performance of the internal-combustion engine.” “This is more than just a quick flip of the dial,” he said. “It’s a very wrenching transition.” It will also be expensive, said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the nonprofit Center for Automotive Research. Converting an assembly plant to produce electric cars is a billion dollar or more investment, she said. And pledging to complete that transition by 2035 is “an aggressive target,” she said. The electric-vehicle industry has grown exponentially in the past decade but still represents less than 2 percent of automobiles sold in the United States. Global electric-vehicle sales grew in 2020 even while the rest of the car market suffered from the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. The International Energy Agency projects that the global number of battery-powered and hybrid vehicles could increase from just over 5 million to nearly 140 million by 2030. The timing of the GM announcement was tied in large part to the election of Joe Biden to the White House. On Wednesday, President Biden detailed a far-reaching plan to transition the U.S. economy away from oil, gas and coal and toward solar, wind and other clean energy. The president said he wants the country to lead the global effort to cut the pollution that is driving climate change and speeding the planet toward environmental catastrophe. As part of several actions, Biden signed an executive order that calls for the federal fleet of approximately 645,000 vehicles to be converted to electric power. He has also vowed to expand charging stations for electric cars, revise and extend electric-vehicle tax credits and tighten fuel economy standards for gas-powered vehicles. “On the heels of the President’s historic actions yesterday, we applaud efforts by the private sector to further embrace renewable and clean energy technologies,” Vedant R. Patel, a White House spokesman, said in an email. “As the President and many others have said, efforts like this will help grow our economy and create good-paying union jobs.” Other government action has also pushed the auto industry toward electrification. California, the world’s fifth-largest economy and the state that created U.S. car culture, will stop sales of gasoline-powered automobiles within 15 years, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) announced in September. The United Kingdom plans to stop the sales of cars and vans powered by gas and diesel by 2030, five years earlier than planned. “Major industries have to kind of look to the future and anticipate it,” Rabe said. “Do you really want to be the last one standing with the possibility that you’re just producing nostalgic vehicles that are being regulated or priced out of existence?” GM’s announcement was seen by others in the automobile industry as a public relations effort to outflank rivals, many of which have already launched aggressive electric-vehicle programs. Volkswagen, for example, is planning to launch almost 70 new electric models in the next 10 years, increase its electric-vehicle production over the next decade to 22 million and pour about $33 billion into electrifying its other vehicles. Ford, which has been building vehicles with internal-combustion engines for more than a century, is spending $11.5 billion through 2022 on new EVs. Tesla plans to increase sales of its all-electric fleet. GM’s stock rose nearly 3.5 percent Thursday. The move toward ending tailpipe emissions will affect GM’s passenger cars and light-duty trucks — SUVs such as the Yukon, as well as vans and minivans and some pickup trucks, such as the Silverado, a company spokeswoman said. But its heavy-duty vehicles — box trucks, tractor trailers, utility trucks and some heavy pickup trucks — will continue to run on gasoline, the company said. GM also said it is working with EVgo to triple the scale of the nation’s largest public fast-charging network by adding more than 2,700 fast chargers by the end of 2025, a move it says will help speed up electric-vehicle adoption. The chargers will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy. Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, which had worked with GM on its plan, called it a “breakthrough moment.” “And it’s part of a wave of industry action that reinforces what the Biden administration is doing,” Krupp said. Biden’s plan to electrify the federal fleet, from postal trucks to government vans, “creates demand and drives down costs as privately owned fleets follow suit,” Krupp said. Some critics said that GM still had not publicly joined four other automakers — Ford, Honda, VW and BMW — that agreed to comply with California’s fuel efficiency standards, which are more stringent than the federal targets under Trump. The California settlement is an important benchmark in restarting negotiations among auto companies, the California Air Resources Board and the Biden administration over cutting greenhouse-gas emissions in the transport sector. For now, GM has still not made as big a commitment as the others through 2026, when fuel economy gets renegotiated again. GM’s statement also left some wiggle room in continuing internal-combustion engines, critics noted. The company did not rule out using carbon offsets or credits “if absolutely necessary” to reach its goal of eliminating tailpipe emissions. That means GM could invest in programs that remove carbon dioxide from the air, such as tree planting, and still sell some gasoline-powered vehicles. And GM said that its plans for “decarbonizing and transitioning to 100 percent EVs” would take place “as supported by our commitment to setting science-based targets.” Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity, said that “given GM’s polluting track record, their promise to arrange some offsets for pollution” suggested that the company’s plan was “just blue smoke and mirrors.” Lawmakers, however, applauded GM’s move. “General Motors committing to exclusively sell zero-emissions vehicles by 2035 and to be carbon neutral by 2040 is a big deal,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said in a statement. “This is good news for our climate and a smart financial move for the company — a win-win.” By pledging to go carbon neutral by 2040, “GM demonstrates that members of the auto industry are committed to tackling the global climate crisis and decarbonizing the transportation sector,” Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), who is a former GM executive and also served as president of the General Motors Foundation, said in a statement. “We have had discussions for months with the auto industry, labor unions, and the environmental community on concrete actions like this that must be taken to reach carbon neutrality.” GM’s announcement showed that “industry does want to work with the administration” and that “industry realizes that climate change is real and action on the part of industry is needed,” Dingell said in an interview. In her statement, she added, “Even as we celebrate this announcement, we need to keep our focus on creating jobs, confronting climate change, and the transformation of an innovative mobility industry.” Paul Bledsoe, a former climate adviser in the Clinton White House, said GM is setting the tone for U.S. manufacturing. “When America’s most iconic manufacturer commits to carbon neutrality, that’s a huge signal to the rest of the economy,” said Bledsoe, who is now at the Progressive Policy Institute. “At the same time, it’s clear GM is trying to burnish its reputation from past practices and justify new tax incentives.” And now, GM will have to persuade American consumers to change a century-old habit. “It will be incumbent on these auto manufacturers to really sell the transition,” Rabe said, “not just with glitzy advertising and sales pitches but delivering on quality of the driving and of the experience.” Sarah Kaplan and Juliet Eilperin contributed to this report.",General Motors to eliminate gasoline and diesel light-duty cars and SUVs by 2035
212,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/27/biden-climate-change/,WP,Towards Left,"Joe Biden had long promised to become the climate president, and on Wednesday he detailed far-ranging plans to shift the U.S. away from fossil fuels, create millions of jobs in renewable energy, and conserve vast swaths of public lands and water. “It’s not time for small measures,” Biden said at the White House, adding that the nation had already wasted precious years as it delayed in dealing with the climate crisis. But as he detailed his plans, the gas, oil and coal industries were already mobilizing on all fronts. From an oil patch in Alaska to state capitals to the halls of Congress, the industries and their allies are aiming to slow Biden’s unprecedented push for climate action and keep profits from fossil fuels flowing. Republican attorneys general from six states wrote to the new president, warning him not to overstep his authority. GOP lawmakers attacked his executive orders as “job killers.” And the petroleum industry revived television ads promoting drilling on federal lands. Industry executives expressed dismay at the scope, speed and direction in which Biden is heading, saying he is going much further than President Barack Obama ever did, while environmentalists said the danger that Earth faces is far more dire now than it appeared during Obama’s tenure and requires an extraordinary response. Last year essentially tied with 2016 as the hottest year ever recorded, and scientists say the planet is speeding toward irreversible damage. In barely a week in office, Biden has moved to rejoin the Paris climate accord, halt the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, impose new limits on oil and gas production, and mandate climate change as a priority across every federal agency. On Wednesday, he promised to use the government’s purchasing power to fund a federal clean-car fleet — and the jobs that would come with it. He pledged to help low-income and minority communities that have historically suffered the worst pollution. And he insisted the nation must set about preparing for the inevitable impacts of climate change, even as it tries to stave off the worst future outcomes. He also said the United States will lead the world in the global effort to cut greenhouse gases that are driving climate change. Biden’s aggressive proposals won broad praise from environmental activists and many fellow Democrats while setting off an intense battle with the U.S. fossil fuel industry, which has underpinned the nation’s economy for more than a century. “This is a radical departure from almost any other administration, and I would even say, President Obama,” said Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), echoing the sentiments of several others in his party and in the fossil fuel industry. “Our states have led the charge in successfully challenging unauthorized and unlawful executive actions, as you know from your years as vice president,” West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and five other Republican attorneys general wrote in a letter to Biden. Morrisey sued to block the Obama administration’s rule curbing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. “You can be assured that we will do so again, if necessary.” American Clean Power Association CEO Heather Zichal, who served as one of Obama’s top climate advisers, said no one should be surprised by Biden’s approach, given the mounting scientific evidence of the Earth’s continued warming and advances in recent years that have helped make renewable energy cheaper. “If we’re going to remove 51 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually and get to zero [emissions] in 30 years, this is going to require drastic action,” she said, adding that her members are prepared to invest $1 trillion in the coming years on clean energy projects. “We see nothing but opportunity.”  Biden’s special envoy on climate, John F. Kerry, told reporters at the White House on Wednesday that the scientific reality gives the president little choice. “It is now cheaper to deal with the crisis of climate than it is to ignore it,” Kerry said, noting the massive sums taxpayers have spent recovering from increasingly devastating hurricanes in recent years. “We’re spending more money, folks. We’re just not doing it smart. We’re not doing it in a way that would actually sustain us for the long term.” In a nation that remains heavily reliant on oil and gas but is shifting toward cleaner energy, the president and his deputies are aware they must take steps to blunt the short-term economic fallout on those impacted by the transition, or risk having them unravel. To that end, the White House is establishing an interagency working group headed by climate coordinator Gina McCarthy and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese that will help communities grappling with the shift away from coal and other fossil fuels. “We’re going to make sure that nobody is left behind,” McCarthy told reporters Wednesday. “We need to put people to work in their own communities. That’s where their home is. That’s where the vision is. So we are creatively looking at those opportunities for investment so that we can get people understanding that we are not trying to take away jobs.” Federal fossil fuel leasing generated nearly $8.1 billion in tax revenue in fiscal 2020, according to the Interior Department’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue, a sum shared among federal, state, local and tribal governments. The practice also accounts for nearly a quarter of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. “Over the years, right or wrong, state budgets and social service provisions have become insidiously entangled with fossil fuel energy profits,” said Chase Huntley, who directs the Wilderness Society’s energy and climate program. Here's how to track Biden's efforts to erase Trump's environmental legacy On his first day as president, Biden rescinded the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline — a project that enjoys the support of some building trade unions — and on Wednesday, he announced an indefinite halt to new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters. In an interview just after the November election, the American Petroleum Institute’s senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs, Frank Macchiarola, said his group was aware of Biden’s plan to impose a leasing moratorium. “But we also recognize that that was a campaign proposal, and campaigning is often different from governing,” he said at the time. This week, Macchiarola said he was surprised that Biden would block a major pipeline in the midst of an economic downturn. “When you launch your campaign, and the unemployment rate is between 3.5 percent and 4 percent, and you take office and the unemployment rate is 6.7 percent, should your policies be the same when a project means thousands of jobs?” Some oil crews have suspended work in reaction to news out of Washington. Dave Cruz’s construction crew had already traveled 100 miles by snow trail to “the middle of nowhere” on the Alaskan tundra last week and were getting ready to prepare a five-acre well pad made of ice when they learned of the tighter restrictions under the Biden administration. “I hate to tell you guys, we’ve got to let you go,” Cruz said he told his nearly 50-person crew on the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, the nation’s largest swath of public land.The Interior Department is poised to issue the permit soon, which would allow the crew to return. The fossil fuel industry also has encouraged  tribal, state, local and labor leaders to weigh in. Biden’s aides clarified this week that any restrictions on new leasing or permitting does not apply to Indian Country, since federal officials would first have to engage in formal consultations with those sovereign nations. “A delay in energy permitting in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic would have been devastating to our economy and the health and safety of our tribal members,” said Ute Indian Tribe Business Committee Chairman Luke Duncan, whose tribe has a drilling operation in Utah. Biden has taken office at an inflection point in U.S. energy policy, where fossil fuels dominate transportation and electricity generation, even as they are starting to lose ground to both market forces and shifting public opinion. David Slater, chairman of the board of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, told reporters Tuesday that natural gas accounted for the largest source of U.S. electricity in 2019, at 38 percent, and the Energy Information Administration projects America’s overall natural gas consumption will “grow slightly” by 2050. At the same time, the oil and gas industry has suffered a series of recent economic setbacks. Tom Sanzillo, director of finance at the Institute for Energy Economics, noted these companies accounted for 28 percent of the U.S. stock market in 1980, but just 2.3 percent of it as of this month. “The oil industry doesn’t have a plan for its future. They want to drill wherever they want, whenever they want,” Sanzillo said. “What Biden is doing is saying, ‘We need to reduce the supply, because the industry is not doing it.’ ” The Trump administration offered more than 103 million acres of oil and gas leases, according to Interior, of which just 10.6 million acres sold. The industry has a considerable stockpile of leases: 53 percent of those onshore are unused or not producing, along with 77 percent of those offshore. And in December alone, the Bureau of Land Management signed off on 847 drilling permits, a rate roughly double what it had approved each month between June and November. Facing catastrophic climate change, this Alaska Native village can't yet quit Big Oil Rystad Energy’s head of shale research, Artem Abramov, said that the pause in new federal leasing would have “little impact” on oil and gas production in federal land, including in New Mexico’s gas-rich Permian Basin. Taylor McKinnon, senior public lands campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity, noted that federal leases sold since 2017 would release 1.9 billion tons of greenhouse gases alone. All of the oil, gas, coal, oil shale and tar sands the U.S. government has leased holds more than 20 times that warming potential, he added.  Whatever legislative, lobbying and legal battles lie ahead, those who have long hoped for strong climate action from the federal government cheered Biden’s actions Wednesday, saying he is pursuing the right path for the country — and for the planet. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) has delivered a “Time to Wake Up” speech about climate change nearly every week the Senate has been in session for the past nine years, frustrated that the U.S. government wasn’t acting more purposefully. On Wednesday, he delivered his 279th speech. It would be his last, he said, because President Biden was forcing the country to finally act. “So instead of urging that it’s time to wake up,” he said, “I close this long run by saying now it’s time to get to work.”","As Biden vows monumental action on climate change, a fight with the fossil fuel industry has only begun"
213,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2021/01/27/climate-curioius-weatherization/,WP,Towards Left,"As a reporter covering climate solutions, I receive one query more than any other: “What’s the best thing for me to do to protect the planet?” The annoyingly squishy answer is: It depends. Politicians can pass legislation, CEOs can change manufacturing processes, farmers can practice regenerative agriculture, school boards and shipping companies can convert their bus and truck fleets to electrical vehicles. Not every solution is going to work for everybody. Teenagers can’t vote, people in rural areas can’t choose not to drive, a single parent working multiple jobs can’t afford to spend extra money on recycled products. So the best thing you can do is whatever most leverages your position, resources and skills to tackle climate change. This year, “Climate Curious” is going to offer guides to doing just that. This one is for people who own their homes (or have a good relationship with their landlords). At the risk of sounding like a piece of circa-2007 clickbait, there is one neat trick homeowners can deploy to shrink their carbon footprint. It’ll make your house more comfortable, save money in the long run and the government might help pay for it. It’s “weatherization” — sealing up your home so you don’t waste energy on heating and cooling that is lost to the outside world. New York’s most famous skyscraper shrank its planet-warming emissions by 40 percent. Can the rest of the city do the same? Weatherization comes in many forms, but the easiest is closing up the cracks around windows and doors. You can first identify leakage points by turning on your kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans, creating a slight pressure differential between indoors and outdoors, then holding up a lit incense stick to potential problem areas. If the smoke wavers or blows in one direction, there’s a draft that needs fixing. Use weatherstripping to insulate windows and install a sweep to the bottom of exterior doors. You can also place a draft stopper — a cylindrical pillow you can get for less than $15 at a hardware store — on windowsills and door thresholds. According to the Energy Department, 25 to 30 percent of household heating and cooling is lost through windows. Just put your hand up to a pane on a winter’s day — feel how cold it is? That’s energy wasted. You can counter this by installing blinds or drapes; one Cornell University analysis found that a simple roller shade can reduce heat loss through a window by 24 to 31 percent. In summertime, glass treatments that block certain wavelengths of light can stop heat seeping into the home. A somewhat more expensive option is to replace your windows. Look for double-, triple- or even quadruple-glazed windows; the more panes of glass the window has, the less heat it will transfer. Even fancier windows will include argon gas — a powerful insulator — between the panes. When shopping, look for performance labels from the National Fenestration Rating Council. (Fun fact: “fenestration” is a noun referring to the design of openings in a building; “defenestration” describes the act of throwing something out a window.) A window’s “U-factor” indicates how well it keeps heat from escaping, while the “solar heat gain coefficient” measures how well it prevents the sun’s warmth from coming in; low scores on both metrics indicate a well-insulated window. If you plan to renovate your house, then it’s a good time to think about sealing up crawl spaces, insulating ducts and repairing the heating and cooling system. The Energy Department has a helpful guide to adding insulation to existing buildings, and most contractors can talk through the best option for your home. Even if you’re not able to do a complete renovation, smaller measures such as putting a thick carpet on the floor of a room over an unheated garage or installing a radiant barrier in an attic that traps summer heat can make a difference. Because weatherization can pose some hefty upfront costs, there are quite a few government programs to help homeowners pay for it. The Energy Department’s Weatherization Assistance Program, which is administered through states and tribes, will pay for upgrades to homes of people who can’t afford them. Weatherization is especially valuable for low-income households, which typically spend more than 16 percent of their annual income on energy bills (compared to 3.5 percent for other households). The Energy Department estimates that the program cuts energy expenses for these households by 35 percent. But if you plan to live in your home for more than 10 years, the measures eventually will pay for themselves. A 2015 study by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory found that the Weatherization Assistance Program delivered $1.40 in energy savings for every dollar invested. When health and safety benefits were wrapped in, the return on each dollar invested increased to more than $4. I spoke to Erich Valo, a photographer and father of two in Oakland, Calif., who implemented a slew of energy efficiency measures when he remodeled his century-old house in 2019. “Choosing to do the weatherization was the easiest part of the remodeling process,” he told me. By installing triple-glazed windows and improving insulation, he cut his winter gas bill by almost 60 percent. His calculations suggest that the savings will exceed the cost of the improvements within 15 years. “But even if we sold the house and didn’t get to reap all the investments, we’d know the next person would also be using less fuel,” he said. The carbon reductions from weatherization measures depend on how you heat and cool your home. Valo’s house is heated with natural gas, which generates 117 pounds of carbon dioxide per million British Thermal Units (a measurement of heat). That means his efficiency measures are saving more than 1,500 pounds of carbon dioxide every winter — the equivalent of canceling a road trip from D.C. to Denver. It’s a bit more complicated to calculate carbon savings from weatherizing homes that are heated electrically, or use air conditioning in the summer, because those numbers depend on how your electricity is produced. But even if your energy comes entirely from solar or another renewable source, improving efficiency can help take pressure off the grid — something that will become increasingly important as more people purchase electric vehicles and appliances. People often tell me they feel powerless in the face of the scale of the climate crisis. That’s fair: Humanity produced about 34 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2020, a figure that makes Valo’s 1,500 pounds of savings seem a bit puny. The sweeping social and economic transformation that scientists say is needed to attack the problem will require a global effort. But individual actions can still be meaningful, especially if they are followed up with advocacy. I often think about something climate scientist Daniel Swain explained to me last year: The physics of the greenhouse effect mean that climate effects such as wildfires and hurricanes become exponentially worse with each incremental increase in global temperatures. That means every pound of CO2 cut, every bit of warming avoided, helps secure a safer future. No action, however small, is pointless. And if each person who pursues weatherization convinces two friends to do the same, then the effects of their action also grow exponentially. Valo’s 1,500 pounds of carbon savings could become 3,000, then 6,000. If all 139 million households in the United States used efficiency measures to cut their heating and cooling costs by a third, the country would save almost 150 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. Neat trick, huh? Do you have questions about climate change? Ask us here and maybe we’ll feature your question next!",How to stop your house’s expensive drafts — and save the planet
214,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/26/biden-environmental-justice-climate/,WP,Towards Left,"President Biden made tackling America’s persistent racial and economic disparities a central part of his plan to combat climate change Wednesday, prioritizing environmental justice for the first time in a generation. As part of an unprecedented push to cut the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions and create new jobs as the United States shifts toward cleaner energy, Biden directed agencies across the federal government to invest in low-income and minority communities that have traditionally borne the brunt of pollution. “Lifting up these communities makes us all stronger as a nation and increases the health of everybody,” Biden said. Biden signed an executive order establishing a White House interagency council on environmental justice, create an office of health and climate equity at the Health and Human Services Department, and form a separate environmental justice office at the Justice Department. The order also directs the government to spend 40 percent of its sustainability investments on disadvantaged communities. “It’s hard,” the president said, referring to communities that are just a fenceline away from polluting facilities. “The hard-hit areas like Cancer Alley in Louisiana, or the Route 9 Corridor in the state of Delaware. That’s why we’re going to work to make sure that they receive 40 percent of the benefits of key federal investments in clean energy, clean water and wastewater infrastructure.” Cathleen Kelly, a fellow who focuses on energy and environment at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, called the actions “a historic commitment.” “The executive order will help to lay out a clear path to implementing President Biden’s climate and justice commitments,” Kelly said. “It will get the gears turning in each agency across the federal government. With Biden in the White House and the current leaders we have in Congress, this year represents an unprecedented opportunity to have executive and legislative action.” Tracking Biden’s environmental actions At the heart of Biden’s executive action Wednesday is an effort to improve conditions in Black, Latino and Native American communities targeted for hazards that others did not want: power plants, landfills, trash incinerators, shipping ports, uranium mines and factories. Communities where air quality is poor suffer from higher levels of asthma and respiratory and heart diseases. African Americans and Latinos, along with Native Americans, have suffered disproportionately from the coronavirus, a respiratory illness, and are more likely to die. Robert Bullard, a professor at Texas Southern University and longtime environmental justice advocate, praised the notion of linking the environment and health by establishing a dedicated office at HHS. And he said creating an environmental justice office at the Justice Department underscores that the problem is both important and pervasive. “When you have the most powerful legal department in the country saying that environmental justice is a basic right, I think that is a signal being sent across the country to say that this is real at the highest level,” Bullard said. The moves are part of a far-reaching, all-of-government effort to transition the United States away from fossil fuels — a goal that Biden has consistently listed as a top priority and one that will undoubtedly include powerful allies and fierce resistance alike. With historic Cabinet picks, Biden puts environmental justice front and center The push to scale back the nation’s carbon emissions, while also addressing the historical burden of pollution on minority communities, is coming not only from the White House but also from the Democratic-led Congress. “It is central,” Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) said Monday in an interview with MSNBC, saying he agrees with Biden that pursuing a bold environmental agenda will also be good for the economy. “One of the things that’s always pained me is that so many working people think climate [action] will leave them out, when it actually will increase the number of good-paying jobs, as long as we make sure it’s American jobs.” He added, “Climate is central, but jobs and dealing with racial inequities are part of it.” Biden’s new measures will also face stiff opposition in some quarters and a lingering skepticism in areas of the country he has pledged to help. In 1994, President Bill Clinton issued an executive order directing agencies to identify and address the “disproportionately high and adverse” health and environmental impacts of their policies on poor and minority populations. But it has been applied intermittently over the past quarter-century. In an interview Tuesday, Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) said Biden’s decision to curtail oil and gas jobs would disproportionately harm Alaska Natives, who have relied on energy development to lift their communities out of poverty. He noted that when the American Medical Association surveyed life expectancy in communities across the nation, residents on Alaska’s North Slope and the Aleutian Islands made the biggest gains. “These were some of the poorest places in America, almost exclusively Native. And when they got resource development, they got things most Americans take for granted: health clinics, gymnasiums and flush toilets,” Sullivan said. “Now we have an administration that directly targets these opportunities and turns racial equity on its head.” The Alaska Native community is split on the issue of fossil fuel development. Many elected leaders, including North Slope Borough Mayor Harry Brower Jr., have lobbied for expanding drilling in the state. But others, including youth activists who successfully passed a resolution at the Alaska Federation of Natives’ 2019 conference calling climate change a threat to their traditions, oppose it. Some communities that have traditionally relied on fossil fuel jobs have found themselves wondering what opportunities will come their way under a Biden administration and whether workers in fading industries such as coal will be left behind. In Adams County, Ohio, where two coal-fired power plants closed in 2019, the more than 500 jobs they once provided are gone. While two solar farms exist nearby, they and other businesses have not filled the employment void — and the massive hole in the local tax base. “We’re all for renewables and stuff like that, but at the end of the day, people have to make a living,” Adams County Commissioner Ty Pell said in an interview, noting that solar farms, once built, require far fewer ongoing employees than a massive power plant. But Rev. Susan Hendershot, president of Interfaith Power & Light, praised the administration for pushing the nation’s energy sector in a different direction. “Today’s executive actions show a commitment to bold solutions to the climate crisis, and to centering environmental justice in those solutions,"" Hendershot said. ""The U.S. has a moral opportunity to model the kind of leadership that creates economic, racial, and climate justice for the most vulnerable populations in our communities and our common home. We look forward to seeing a continued faithful commitment to environmental justice and caring for our sacred earth.”",Biden to place environmental justice at center of sweeping climate plan
215,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/25/biden-drilling-moratorium/,WP,Towards Left,"President Biden is poised to impose a moratorium on new federal oil and gas leasing Wednesday, according to three people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plan was still being finalized. The move will deliver on one of Biden’s boldest climate campaign pledges but will encounter stiff resistance from the fossil fuel industry. The White House has prepared documents that would pause new oil and gas auctions on federal land and water as the new administration reviews the program, these people said. The moratorium would not affect existing leases, meaning drilling would continue on public land in the West as well as in the Gulf of Mexico. The memo remains a draft subject to final approval, said one person close to the White House who spoke on the condition of anonymity because it had not been formally announced. Administration officials had considered imposing a moratorium on new federal coal leasing as well, but one of the people briefed on the plan said officials are leaning against that option. Biden plans to outline steps Wednesday aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions and elevating the role of science in federal decision-making. Other new policies include protecting 30 percent of federal land and water by the end of the decade and identifying climate change as a national security priority. Asked about the matter, the White House and the Interior Department declined to comment. During the campaign, Biden pledged to ban “new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters,” without specifying exactly what such a ban would entail. Fossil fuel leasing on federal and tribal land accounts for nearly a quarter of the country’s annual carbon output. The drilling program also generated nearly $8.1 billion in tax revenue for the federal, state, local and tribal governments last year, according to the Interior Department’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue. Trump rolled back more than 200 environmental policies. Here's how Biden is restoring them. Environmentalists say the pause will allow the new administration to assess whether taxpayers are being adequately compensated for the minerals extracted from land they own. “By pausing the broken leasing system and halting the giveaways to oil and gas executives, President Biden has an opportunity to meaningfully fix the leasing system for the first time in nearly four decades with solutions that work for the public and which incorporate ambitious conservation, taxpayer fairness, and climate goals,” Jenny Rowland-Shea, senior policy analyst for public land at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, wrote in an email. “We can make sure our public lands and coasts are preserved, accessible and beneficial to everyone — not abused by oil and gas corporations.” But oil and gas groups, including the American Petroleum Institute, counter that freezing new leasing will deprive state and local governments, as well as the U.S. Treasury, of needed revenue. Last week, the industry criticized the Interior Department when it dictated that any new leases or permits issued during the next 60 days needed the approval of a top-ranking Biden appointee before they could be finalized. API President Mike Sommers said that move alone will damage domestic energy producers while benefiting those abroad. “Restricting development on federal lands and waters is nothing more than an ‘import more oil’ policy,” Sommers said. “Energy demand will continue to rise — especially as the economy recovers — and we can choose to produce that energy here in the United States or rely on foreign countries hostile to American interests.” About 22 percent of U.S. oil production and 12 percent of natural gas production takes place on federal land and water, according to API. A moratorium would have contrasting effects on different oil-producing regions, hamstringing drillers in New Mexico, where the federal government controls huge swaths of land, while leaving those producing on state or private land across the border in Texas unscathed. “It feels a little bit unfair,” said Raye Miller, head of a small nine-well oil-producing operation called Regeneration Energy in southeastern New Mexico. “We’re very concerned with the direction things are headed.” But drilling on public land will continue even with a moratorium on new leasing, because industry operators hold plenty of undeveloped leases in their portfolios. Only about half of the nearly 20,000 applications to drill approved between 2014 and 2019 are in use, according to a recent Government Accountability Office report. More than 13 million acres of land leased for oil and gas were not producing during fiscal 2019. While the oil and gas lobby gears up for a fight, environmental advocates are sustaining pressure on Biden to keep his commitment to end leasing and permitting on federal acreage. Among them is Oceana, a marine conservation group, which is set to release a report Tuesday detailing how reversing the Trump administration’s plan to open up nearly all U.S. coastal water to drilling would prevent more than 19 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Activists have been pleased with Biden’s quick climate actions. “At this point, I’m excited about the president’s agenda,” said Diane Hoskins, a campaign director at Oceana. An earlier version of this story misstated the amount of tax revenue generated by federal oil and gas drilling last fiscal year. It was nearly $8.1 billion, not $11.7 billion. This report has been updated.",Biden poised to halt new fossil fuel leasing on federal land and water Wednesday
216,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/25/manchin-climate-congress/,WP,Towards Left,"He’s a coal country native, born to a family of mining town mayors. As West Virginia governor, he sued the Environmental Protection Agency. He has scuttled efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, criticized the Paris climate agreement and famously shot a copy of a cap-and-trade carbon proposal full of lead. Now the fate of the most ambitious climate agenda ever proposed by an American president rests in his hands. Sen. Joe Manchin III, who is set to become chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is a conservative Democrat from one of the reddest states in the country. In a Senate split 50-50, Manchin is also a crucial swing vote on contentious legislation, defining the limits of what President Biden and the Democrats can accomplish. Over the weekend, he led a bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers in talks with the White House over its proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. But perhaps few of Biden’s priorities will be as polarizing as the environment. The president ran on a $2 trillion plan to transition the U.S. economy toward renewable-energy sources and cut the planet-warming pollution that comes from oil, gas and coal. Biden has framed his proposal as a jobs plan, but the fossil fuel industry — including coal companies — warns of economic fallout: lost jobs and tax revenue and higher consumer costs. Manchin has already said he doesn’t support eliminating the filibuster as a way to enable Democrats to pass bills without Republican votes. If Democrats are to fight climate change, he wants them to do it the old fashioned way — his way. That means deals forged through compromise, the gears of government greased by long-standing relationships and the occasional Mason jar of moonshine served during negotiations. “I want to work with them and hear all different sides of it, from the environmental to the industrial base,” Manchin said in a recent interview. But the physics of greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere are nonnegotiable. Scientists say nations need to dramatically cut emissions to avoid catastrophic warming that would come with its own economic toll: devastating fires and floods, water scarcity, displacement, disease, and death. It remains to be seen whether a moderate like Manchin can help bring about the change the planet demands. The man in the middle In a bitterly divided Washington, Joe Manchin is a rare breed. A habitual aisle-crosser, he maintains strong friendships with Republican colleagues like Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), the Energy Committee’s outgoing chair. He attacked Barack Obama’s environmental policies and voted to confirm more of Donald Trump’s Cabinet appointees than any other Democrat. He claims to hate everything about Washington, sleeping on a houseboat named “Almost Heaven” rather than getting an apartment in the city. But in 2018, when Manchin announced he was fed up with the Senate, party leaders talked him into running for another term, figuring he was probably the only Democrat in West Virginia who would win. Manchin, 73, is a native son who made good: Star student in the small mining town of Farmington. Promising quarterback for the West Virginia University Mountaineers until a knee injury ended his career. Successful businessman who oversaw a coal brokerage before running for public office. His political star rose even as his state grew more conservative. In 2004, the same year West Virginia voted for Republican President George W. Bush by a 13-point margin, Manchin was handily elected governor. He impressed constituents by pushing through new safety regulations in 24 hours after a mining disaster killed 14 people. “What’s in it for West Virginia?” is Manchin’s guiding principle, former staffers say. The Paris climate agreement wasn’t good for the roughly 20,000 West Virginians who work in coal, oil and gas, he said. He argued that Obama’s Clean Power Plan would make electricity for his constituents less affordable. Manchin also maintains a vested interest in his state’s fossil fuel industry. His most recent financial disclosures show that he holds stocks worth between $1 million and $5 million in Enersystems, the coal brokerage firm he used to run. Fellow Democratic senators are understanding of his predicament. When Manchin talks with Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), he draws an analogy between tourism in Hawaii and coal in West Virginia. “He said, ‘Well, what would happen if someone came into your state and said your No. 1 industry is the problem?’” according to Schatz. That doesn’t mean liberals haven’t tried to persuade him. In 2014, Manchin and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) arranged a cultural exchange. Manchin boarded a trawler on the Rhode Island Sound so fishermen could tell the coal state senator about how climate change had affected their livelihoods. “I remember the captain of the trawler that we went out on saying to us: ‘Senator, this is not my father’s ocean any longer. Things are getting weird out there,’” Whitehouse said. In turn, Whitehouse, who like Schatz is one of the most outspoken senators on climate change, took a trip to coal country, saying afterward that he had learned to see miners as “energy veterans” who needed to be considered in any climate legislation. Some of Manchin’s stances have changed in parallel with the coal industry’s declining fortunes and climate change’s rising toll. The same man who once sued the EPA over restrictions on mountaintop removal mining eventually asked federal officials to study the environmental harm from the practice, saying, “I think the method has exceeded its useful life.” In 2018, when Manchin was made ranking Democrat on the Senate committee that oversees energy resources and development, nuclear waste policy, and public lands, many environmentalists were outraged at the elevation of an outspoken advocate for fossil fuels. He “simply can’t be trusted to make the bold, progressive decisions we need” on the Energy Committee, said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), who ran unsuccessfully last year for the Democratic presidential nomination on a climate platform. But working with Murkowski, Manchin pushed through a sharply divided Congress the biggest conservation legislation in a decade, helped fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund for the first time in a half-century and made sure the latest coronavirus stimulus bill included billions for solar, wind and battery storage. Manchin’s environmental score as kept by the League of Conservation Voters jumped from a low of 20 percent in 2014 to a high of 86 percent in 2019. “Folks are always trying to figure out his evolution, did he change because of this or that,” said Collin O’Mara, chief executive of the National Wildlife Federation and a friend of Manchin’s. But the explanation is not so much a change of heart as a change of circumstances, O’Mara said. In light of the declining demand for coal — a consequence of shifting markets more than government regulation — Manchin sees clean-energy investments as a chance to create new jobs. “Everything he’s done throughout his career [is] to make sure there’s some level of economic opportunity back home,” O’Mara said. “If you understand that about him, everything else makes sense.” A climate compromise? When the Democrats clinched control of the Senate with a pair of Georgia victories on Jan. 6, Manchin became not just the top lawmaker on energy but one of the most powerful people in Washington. Even laws approved through budget reconciliation — a process that requires a simple majority for passage — will rely on his support. What a “golden opportunity to get compromise back,” Manchin recalled thinking that morning. After four years of Trump “playing to his base and that’s about it,” he said in a recent interview, “I think it’s great Democrats get to set the agenda and see if they can make this place work.” Mere hours later, he found himself in an undisclosed location in the bowels of the Capitol, sheltering from rioters incited by Trump and some of Manchin’s own Republican colleagues. While the mob raged, Manchin tried to reason with GOP senators who planned to object to the electoral college votes. At least two he lobbied, Sens. Steve Daines (Mont.) and James Lankford (Okla.), stood down. But in the end, eight returned to the chamber they’d fled and still voted to dispute the results. That incident undeniably pushed the parties further apart, Manchin acknowledges. Now, to have any hope of passing something as contentious as comprehensive climate legislation, some environmental activists argue that Democrats must be willing to bypass Republican objections by eliminating the filibuster, a tactic that blocks consideration of legislation unless 60 senators agree to end debate and move to a vote. “The scientists have told us we have a handful of years, if not no time at all, to completely transform our society,” said Sunrise Movement spokesman Garrett Blad. He called it “naive” to think that such a plan would receive support from at least 10 Republicans, the minimum needed to join with 50 Democrats to pass legislation. But if any Democrat could find common ground with the GOP, it’s Manchin, said West Virginia Rivers Coalition Executive Director Angie Rosser. She pointed to the success of the bipartisan energy package included in last month’s stimulus bill, which one green group heralded as “perhaps the most significant climate legislation Congress has ever passed.” Manchin is saying little about how he will manage the Energy Committee as chairman — besides making sure that “there’s a balance between the environment and economy” and that no “heavy-lifting areas in this country” are left behind. To that end, any major climate proposal with a chance of getting Manchin’s vote will in some way include “carbon capture” technology, which absorbs carbon dioxide before it exits smokestacks. That’s not only a way to allow coal- and gas-fired power plants to keep operating in a zero-emissions world, but a boon for West Virginia, which hosts an Energy Department lab in Morgantown that is a center for carbon capture research. Rosser gives Manchin credit for acknowledging that the energy economy is changing while other West Virginia politicians still promise to “bring coal back.” “To have someone like Joe Manchin speaking that truth … it’s a welcome thing because now we can talk about what’s next,” she said. “One of the reasons I’m excited about him being in this key position is that West Virginia needs someone who can lead on federal policy in a way that doesn’t leave us out.” At the same time, fossil fuel groups still see him as a potential ally. “I think Senator Manchin is somebody that our industry can work with,” said Frank Macchiarola, senior vice president for policy at the American Petroleum Institute. “Hailing from a state that’s rich in coal and natural gas resources, he’s someone who recognized those are an important part of the mix as well.” The biggest piece of Biden’s climate plan that requires congressional approval is a set of requirements on power plants to eliminate their contributions to climate change by 2035. Ever mindful of Capitol Hill dynamics, the former senator from Delaware made sure coal- and gas-fired power plants could continue to operate, as long as they captured the carbon they emitted. Even so, Manchin is leery about setting a standard for power companies that depends on technology that isn’t yet cheap and effective enough. Manchin is also wary of the Paris accord, which Biden moved to rejoin on his first day in office. The senator echoes Republican critiques that the international agreement, designed to keep the global temperature increase “well below” 2 degrees Celsius, demands too little of developing nations. Still, climate change can’t be ignored, even in coal country. Constituents in West Virginia are noticing the more frequent floods linked to increased precipitation, Manchin noted. “There’s nobody I know in my state that wants to drink dirty water, to breathe dirty air, I can assure you,” he said. “I’m as environmental as anyone else. I’m pretty rational, practical about it, too.”",One coal state senator holds the key to Biden’s ambitious climate agenda. And it’s not McConnell.
217,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/25/ice-melt-quickens-greenland-glaciers/,WP,Towards Left,"Global ice loss has increased rapidly over the past two decades, and scientists are still underestimating just how much sea levels could rise, according to alarming new research published this month. From the thin ice shield covering most of the Arctic Ocean to the mile-thick mantle of the polar ice sheets, ice losses have soared from about 760 billion tons per year in the 1990s to more than 1.2 trillion tons per year in the 2010s, a new study released Monday shows. That is an increase of more than 60 percent, equating to 28 trillion tons of melted ice in total — and it means that roughly 3 percent of all the extra energy trapped within Earth’s system by climate change has gone toward turning ice into water. “That’s like more than 10,000 ‘Back to the Future’ lightning strikes per second of energy melting ice around-the-clock since 1994,” said William Colgan, an ice-sheet expert at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. “That is just a bonkers amount of energy.” There is good reason to think the rate of ice melt will continue to accelerate. A second, NASA-backed study on the Greenland ice sheet, for instance, finds that no less than 74 major glaciers that terminate in deep, warming ocean waters are being severely undercut and weakened. Scientists descended into Greenland’s perilous ice caverns — and came back with a worrying message And it asserts that the extent of this effect, along with its implications for rising seas, is still being discounted by the global scientific community. Failing to fully account for the role of ocean undercutting means sea-level rise from the ice sheets may be underestimated by “at least a factor of 2,” the new paper in the journal Science Advances finds. “It’s like cutting the feet off the glacier rather than melting the whole body,” said Eric Rignot, a study co-author and a glacier researcher at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of California at Irvine. “You melt the feet and the body falls down, as opposed to melting the whole body.” “I think this is an example that the current projections are conservative,” Rignot said. “As we peer below we realize these feedbacks are kicking in faster than we thought.” Together, the two studies present a worrying picture. The first finds that the current ice losses, which are accelerating quickly, are on pace with the worst scenarios for sea-level rise put out by the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). That expert body found that ice sheets could drive as much as 16 inches of sea-level rise by 2100. But on top of that, the new NASA work on Greenland suggests that the IPCC, whose sea-level projections have long been faulted as being conservative, could underestimate future sea-level rise if the panel, which has a new report expected later this year, does not take full account of the power of the ocean to knock the ice backward and undermine it. The first study, in the journal The Cryosphere and led by University of Leeds researcher Thomas Slater, is basically an enormous work of accounting. It tallies losses from the vast Greenland ice sheet, to the jagged peaks of the Himalayas and then southward to Antarctica during the 23-year period from 1994 through 2017. Not all the ice the planet has lost translates directly into rising seas. For instance, 7.6 trillion tons, the largest single total, comes from the melting of the floating ice cover of the Arctic Ocean, which does not raise seas at all. Nor do the 6.5 trillion tons subtracted from Antarctic ice shelves, as those, too, were already afloat. Still, the loss of floating ice paves the way for the unlocking of ice on land in Greenland and Antarctica, where 99 percent of all the planet’s fresh water sits in frozen form, crushing down the invisible landforms beneath it. Greenland and Antarctica together have lost 6.3 trillion tons since 1994, the research finds, leaving out the past three years, which would surely add at least another trillion on top of that. Greenland’s ice losses have septupled and are now in line with its highest sea-level scenario, scientists say So far, the world’s mountain glaciers have actually been keeping pace with the ice sheets, losing 6.1 trillion tons of ice over the same time period and thus adding roughly the same amount to sea level. Over time — probably starting right around now — the polar ice sheets will begin to massively outdistance the losses from mountain glaciers and become the dominant drivers of global sea-level rise. “It is no surprise that the ice on our planet is melting,” said Robin Bell, an expert on the polar ice sheets at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. “We have turned up the temperature, and just like you can watch an ice cube in your glass melt on a hot summer day, our actions are melting our planet’s ice.” The question now becomes: Just how fast will climate change lead to the melting of the biggest and thickest ice, the ice atop Greenland and Antarctica? That’s where the results of a six-year NASA campaign to study the influence of warming ocean waters on the melting of Greenland’s glaciers have some unsettling news. Together with the University of Leeds study, the NASA research helps show why global ice loss is likely to further speed up as global warming continues. One of the main mechanisms causing Greenland’s glaciers to flow faster into the sea, unlocking inland ice and allowing it to slide toward the coast as well, is the encroachment of warm water underneath the ice in the many deep fjords of coastal Greenland. Scientists have observed accelerating ice loss in nearly every sector of the Greenland ice sheet. While researchers have suspected that warming ocean waters, rather than increasing air temperatures alone, may be behind the melting of glaciers in typically frigid northwest Greenland, for example, the evidence had previously been lacking. The new study, led by glaciologist Mike Wood, also of UC-Irvine and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, relies on measurements taken via hundreds of instruments deployed by aircraft and ships for the past six years, revealing the shape of the land that lurks under the ice where 226 glaciers terminate in the sea, as well as the temperature structure of waters coming into contact with the ice. Glaciers that flow into Greenland’s deepest fjords are losing the most ice, Wood said. The 74 glaciers situated in deep, steep-walled valleys accounted for nearly half of Greenland’s total ice loss between 1992 and 2017, the study found. Greenland is now the largest contributor to global sea-level rise. “In these deep fjords, warm water lurks hundreds of feet below the ocean surface, melting the glaciers from below,” Wood said. “When those warm waters become even warmer — a phenomenon we saw through the early 2000s — the melt increases, causing the glaciers to recede, become unstable and lose ice.” The science produced by the six-year field campaign, known as Oceans Melting Greenland, may force modelers to rethink their estimates for future ice loss, not just in Greenland but also for glaciers where similar dynamics are at work in Antarctica, such as in the West Antarctic ice sheet. The NASA-led research shows that the undercutting of glaciers by relatively mild ocean waters explains why so many of Greenland’s glaciers have sped their movement into the ocean, adding to sea-level rise, while some others have not accelerated as much. In many coastal locations, relatively mild, salty waters sit below a layer of colder, fresher water in glacial fjords. These mild waters are coming into contact with the base of glaciers, where ice meets bedrock, which destabilizes the ice. “A large amount of a glacier’s stability depends on ice at its base,” Wood said. “Remove it and you destabilize the whole thing, like Achilles’ heel.” At the same time, during the summer months, meltwater from inland areas can flow all the way to the base of glaciers that end in the sea and pour into the fjords. This fresh water can drag some of the heavier, warm water toward the surface, accelerating melting further. The NASA data shows that the shape of the land undergirding glaciers and the water temperatures in coastal areas help determine the rate of Greenland’s ice loss, but this information isn’t being translated yet into projections for sea-level rise. “Very few ice-sheet models include that ice process at the frontal margin with realistic forcing,” Rignot said. If models were to include undercutting, their estimates of sea-level rise from the faster loss of coastal glaciers could be up to twice what they are now, the study shows. “I think that’s a big deal,” Rignot said. “You have to account for ocean temperatures in fjords and undercutting. If it’s not in your model, you won’t get the prediction right.” The Greenland results add urgency for research into the mechanisms that are destabilizing ice in Antarctica, where melting from warming oceans coming into contact with the base of glaciers is the main contributing factor, rather than increasing air temperatures. “Because scientific progress is so often built small step on top of small step, I am not surprised by their findings,” said Twila Moon, a research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo, who wasn’t involved in either study. “But their results are still devastating, further confirming that we are losing ice both from a warming atmosphere and from a warming ocean.” “Ice loss is not a process that will stop itself,” Moon said. “We humans are the ones with our hand on the climate control knob, and our decisions are the most important in determining the future of Greenland ice.”",Earth is now losing 1.2 trillion tons of ice each year. And it’s going to get worse.
218,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/20/biden-climate-change-inauguration/,WP,Towards Left,"During his first moments in the Oval Office on Wednesday, President Biden returned the United States to the Paris climate accord and directed federal agencies to begin unraveling Donald Trump’s environmental policies — the first step in what Biden has vowed will be a sustained effort to safeguard the nation’s air and water, protect endangered species and combat climate change at home and abroad. Biden’s executive order recommitting the United States to the international struggle to slow global warming fulfilled a campaign promise and represented a stark repudiation of the “America First” approach of Trump, who officially withdrew the nation from the Paris agreement Nov. 4 after years of disparaging it. Biden also ordered federal agencies to review scores of climate and environmental policies enacted during the Trump years and, if possible, to quickly reverse them. Nearly half of the regulations the new administration is targeting come from the Environmental Protection Agency, on issues as varied as drinking water, dangerous chemicals and gas-mileage standards. “A cry for survival comes from the planet itself. A cry that can’t be any more desperate or any more clear,” Biden, who has listed tackling climate change as one of his core priorities, said in his inaugural address Wednesday. Listing the challenges the nation faces, he pointed to “the battle to save our planet by getting the climate under control.” Biden’s new national climate adviser, Gina McCarthy, told reporters this week that the moves will “begin undoing some of the harmful actions that happened in the previous administration’s watch, so that we can move forward in combating the climate crisis.” How Joe Biden’s surprisingly ambitious climate plan came together McCarthy said Biden would sign “a broad executive order that takes steps that are imperative to address our climate crisis, and will also create good union jobs and advance environmental justice while reversing more than 100 of the previous administration’s harmful policies.” Biden is expected to take even more sweeping action next Wednesday, according to a document obtained by The Washington Post. He plans to sign an executive order elevating climate in domestic and national security policy; direct “science and evidence based decision-making” in federal agencies; reestablish the Presidential Council of Advisers on Science and Technology and announce that U.S. data that will help underpin the Climate Leadership Summit that Biden will host in Washington in late April. Though incoming presidents often sign executive orders on their first day, the chasm between Biden’s agenda and Trump’s legacy is one of the widest in recent decades. Nowhere is that contrast more pronounced than on climate change — which Trump largely dismissed altogether — and the environment, where Trump and his deputies scaled back a range of protections to benefit the fossil fuel industry. Biden comes to office with a sense of urgency about climate change that is unmatched by any previous occupant of the White House, and he is installing throughout the government people who share his views. The regulations he is instructing agencies to review include a recent Labor Department rule preventing environmentally sustainable mutual funds from being default retirement investments and a Transportation Department regulation making it easier to transport liquefied natural gas by rail. “At this moment of profound crisis, we have the opportunity to build a more resilient, sustainable economy, one that will put the United States on an irreversible path to achieve net-zero emissions economywide no later than 2050,” McCarthy said. That pledge came as welcome news to many in the international community, which has forged ahead with efforts to combat climate change in recent years without cooperation from the world’s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases. “The United States is such an important actor internationally. So this day today has been creating a lot of expectation everywhere,” Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, said in an interview. “Very few generations have the opportunity to really influence a historical change in the way that humanity evolves. This is one of those moments. So it means a lot to have the U.S. back.” Though many of Biden’s actions Wednesday will take effect over time — the country will again formally become a party to the Paris agreement 30 days from now — his most immediate action will be to rescind the presidential permit Trump granted the Keystone XL pipeline to transport crude oil from Canada across the border into the United States. The project became a flash point for climate activists during the Obama administration, and Biden pledged during the campaign to block it. Industry executives made it clear Wednesday that they were prepared to work with Biden but warned him against pushing to abolish fossil fuels. The American Petroleum Institute’s chief executive, Mike Sommers, said in a statement that though his members “support the ambitions of the Paris Agreement,” the new administration should keep in mind “models show that this agreement between nations cannot be achieved without access to natural gas.” And he took issue with Biden’s decision on the Keystone pipeline permit, saying, “Revoking the Keystone XL pipeline is a significant step backwards both for environmental progress and our economic recovery.” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, foreshadowed the opposition Biden’s agenda could face in Congress. “In these next four years, it is imperative that Congress aggressively exercises oversight and pushes back on the worst impulses of Washington bureaucrats,” she said. Conservationists, by contrast, lauded the quick push to roll back so many of Trump’s policies. “Today we are feeling the first rays of hope after four dark years where racial violence and injustice, destruction of our environment and disdain for climate science became standard operating procedure for a government that was supposed to represent us all,” said Jamie Williams, president of the Wilderness Society. Dozens of steps that Biden began during his first hours in office will take months, if not longer, to complete. In Trump's final days, a spree of environmental rollbacks He is instructing the EPA and the Transportation Department to strengthen fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks, which Trump weakened. He asked two other departments, Interior and Commerce, to review the boundaries and protections Trump had scaled back for national monuments in Utah and off the coast of New England. Biden can change the boundaries of a national monument with the stroke of a pen, and though U.S. automakers probably are willing to strike a deal with the new administration on more-ambitious gas-mileage standards for the nation’s cars and pickup trucks, reversing other Trump policies will be more challenging. Biden plans to impose a temporary moratorium on all oil and natural gas leasing activities in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which is home to caribou, polar bears and Indigenous people. But on Tuesday, Interior’s Bureau of Land Management signed and issued nine leases it auctioned off earlier this month, spanning 437,804 acres on the refuge’s coastal plain. All but two of the new leases were won by the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, an arm of the Alaska state government. The sale raised a total of roughly $14 million, less than 2 percent of what congressional Republicans projected when they opened the near-pristine reserve to drilling in 2017. In a diminished national monument in Utah, visions of the West's past and future collide BLM Alaska State Director Chad Padgett said Tuesday that the leases “reflect a solid commitment by both the state and industry to pursue responsible oil and gas development on the Alaska’s North Slope.”    In some instances, Biden is already setting the stage for changes that will reverberate throughout the federal government. For instance, he will revive an interagency working group Trump disbanded in 2017 that sets the “social cost of carbon,” an estimation of the economic damage caused by the release of a ton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Policymakers factor this figure into the cost-and-benefit calculations they make on a host of issues, including permitting new oil wells and imposing stricter pollution controls on coal- and gas-fired power plants. Under the Obama administration’s formula, the price per ton would now stand at $52, but Trump officials reduced it to between $1 and $7 per ton. Many economists suggest that the Biden administration start at $125 per ton to better reflect new research on the economic damage of climate change and market realities. “It is the one way you can uniformly incorporate the cost of climate change into decisions across all of government,” Kevin Rennert, who directs the Social Cost of Carbon Initiative at the environmental think tank Resources for the Future, said in an interview. Biden’s environmental push on Day 1 far surpassed that of any other president, but only time will show how much of his agenda he can actually finish — and how successfully he can rebuild the nation’s image around the world, particularly when it comes to leading on climate action. “Rejoining the Paris agreement is only the beginning, and the incoming administration appears to know this. In order to make truly meaningful progress towards global cooperation on climate, the Biden administration must follow up with concrete actions,” Brandon Wu, director of policy and campaigns at ActionAid USA, said in an email. “There’s simply no reason for other countries to trust our word if we fail, again, to act on our own emissions and use the significant resources at our disposal to support the world’s most vulnerable countries.”","Biden rejoins Paris climate accord, works to overturn Trump’s climate policies"
219,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/19/federal-circuit-court-scraps-trump-administration-power-plant-rules/,WP,Towards Left,"A federal appellate court on Thursday scrapped a Trump administration rule that eased limits on carbon dioxide emissions from coal- and natural-gas-fired power plants, and it effectively revived the Obama administration’s tougher Clean Power Plan. In sweeping away the Trump administration’s regulation, dubbed the Affordable Clean Energy rule, the decision by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit raised hopes among environmental groups that the new Biden administration might be able to replace some Trump administration rules more easily than it feared. “Today’s decision is the perfect Inauguration Day present for America,” said Ben Levitan, a senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund. “It confirms that the Trump administration’s dubious attempt to get rid of common-sense limits on climate pollution from power plants was illegal.” The Obama-era Clean Power Plan had mandated that power plants make 32 percent reductions in emissions below 2005 levels by 2030. The plan gave states wide flexibility in figuring out how best to meet the new targets, but most coal plants would have been forced into retirement. The Clean Power Plan, however, ran into legal difficulties in 2016, and the issues were not resolved before President Trump came into office. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, signed the new rule in June 2019, saying that it would lower electricity costs and that the Obama EPA had overreached. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, however, said Tuesday that the goal of the Trump administration’s EPA had been “to slow the process for reduction of emissions,” and the court called that “arbitrary and capricious.” The three-judge panel said Trump’s EPA “has the legal authority” to adopt new rules regulating those emissions, but that “the central operative terms” of the Trump rule “hinged on a fundamental misconstruction” of the Clean Air Act. Sen. Thomas R. Carper (Del.), the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said the Trump administration rule was “based on a clear misinterpretation of the Clean Air Act.” Carper said “the D.C. Circuit has made clear that EPA can’t turn its back on the agency’s mission to reduce climate pollution.” The EPA had said that the Trump rule “restores rule of law, empowers states, and supports energy diversity.” But Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law & Policy Center, said that the Trump administration “undercut the agency’s responsibility under the Clean Air Act to reduce carbon pollution from coal plants.” He said “this comprehensive court decision clears away the legal underbrush from the Trump administration’s obstructionism.” Kevin S. Minoli, a partner at the law firm Alston & Bird, said that “for most regulations, EPA must go through the time and resource-intensive process of notice and comment rulemaking if it wants to change a rule.” But unlike the EPA, “courts can make an existing regulation go away with the stroke of a pen by issuing an order vacating it.” He cautioned, however, that “whether such an order will be seen as a good thing by the Biden administration will depend on the specific circumstances of each regulation.” Even before the court ruling Tuesday, coal consumption was plunging. The Energy Information Administration, part of the Energy Department, said that over the past five years, coal-fired power plants with 48 gigawatts of capacity had closed down and that this year it expected an additional 2.7 gigawatts of reductions equal in size to about four or five typical plants. These retirements will come primarily from older units. The EIA said the capacity-weighted average age of retiring coal units is more than 51 years old. Nearly two-thirds of the capacity retirements are in four states: Maryland, Florida, Connecticut and Wisconsin, the agency said. The National Mining Association, which represents the coal-mining sector, said it was discouraged by the court decision that may result in tougher regulations on power plants that burn coal. “We are disappointed in and disagree with the ruling, which we are still reviewing, and are exploring our options for next steps,” said spokesman Conor Bernstein. Some lawmakers lamented the court ruling. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) called it “a disaster for regulatory certainty in the power sector, particularly for coal production and generation states.” The decision does not mean entirely smooth sailing for the incoming Biden administration as it pursues its climate agenda. In an opinion dissenting from part of Tuesday’s decision, Judge Justin Walker argued that the EPA never had the authority to enact Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan in the first place. Noting that Walker is a Trump appointee and former clerk to Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, Columbia Law School professor Michael Gerrard said the dissent “could be a bad sign for how the Supreme Court might rule if these issues ever go there.” Jeff Holmstead, a partner at the law firm Bracewell who represents energy companies, said “today’s ruling is a big loss for the Trump administration, but it’s probably not the last word on the matter.” He noted that the Supreme Court before Trump “stopped the Clean Power Plan from coming into effect” while litigation proceeded. “The current Supreme Court is likely to be even more skeptical,” he said.

220,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/18/president-elect-biden-kill-keystone-xl-pipeline-fight-climate-change/,WP,Towards Left,"Signaling his commitment to quickly confront climate change, President-elect Joe Biden is planning to move within days to quash the controversial multibillion-dollar Keystone XL pipeline, according to two individuals familiar with the decision who spoke on the condition of anonymity because it had not been announced yet. The politically symbolic pipeline, promoted by the oil and gas industry since it was first proposed about 15 years ago, has drawn opposition because it would carry tar sands, or heavy bitumen, from the boreal forests of northern Alberta, Canada, to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The energy used in extracting these molasses-like petroleum supplies would contribute heavily to climate change. The move is one of a flurry of environmental actions Biden plans to take after being sworn into office Wednesday. He has already announced that he will rejoin the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change on his first day as president, and his aides are looking at other policies ranging from approving wind projects off the East Coast to restoring protections for national monuments that President Trump unilaterally undercut. “Building new infrastructure like the Keystone XL pipeline, which would result in millions of tons of new carbon emissions, just adds fuel to a fire that’s already burning down our house,” Matt Casale, environment campaigns director of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. “After four years of environmental setbacks, this is just one of a broader set of early actions we expect to see President Biden take to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, accelerate the transition to renewable energy and protect our cherished public lands and oceans.” Trump has worked doggedly to promote Keystone XL and other pipelines across the country, but encountered obstacles both in court and in the private sector. As large financial institutions have become more sensitive to climate considerations, several major banks have announced that they would no longer lend money to oil sands extraction projects. In addition to opposition from environmentalists and climate experts, the pipeline has also sparked criticism from farmers, ranchers and indigenous leaders who do not want to be forced to let the pipeline company gain rights of way through eminent domain, and who fear that the pipeline might one day leak into rivers or aquifers. Biden plans to rescind the cross-border permit the project needs to operate, according to the individuals briefed on the decision. President Obama rejected the permit in 2015. Acting soon would bring a certain symmetry to Biden’s move; President Trump approved a right of way for the Keystone XL pipeline on his third day in office, though the pipeline remained bogged down in courts and by the Nebraska Public Service Commission. The Biden transition team declined to comment on the matter. The pipeline, originally expected to cost about $8 billion, was to carry about 830,000 barrels a day of crude oil, virtually all of it coming 1,210 miles from the tar sands to Steele City, Neb. A southern leg from Cushing, Okla., a major storage hub, to the Gulf Coast was approved in 2012 and constructed. Most of the northern leg has also been completed, with some of the most important gaps in Nebraska. In the absence of the Keystone XL, the oil industry has been shipping oil sands crude on railways and through an existing pipeline, simply called Keystone. The capacity of that pipeline has been increased during the Trump administration. Fearing that Biden might move quickly to block the Keystone XL pipeline, the National Association of Manufacturers, the pipeline company TC Energy and construction unions have rallied to stress that the pipeline project itself would run on renewable energy and would bring job benefits. “If this union project is blocked, workers and families will lose a huge opportunity,” they wrote in a letter to Biden on Monday night. An oil rush up north: Alberta’s tar sands drive TransCanada to build the Keystone XL TC Energy, the pipeline company previously known as TransCanada, has pledged to make its Keystone XL operations net-zero in emissions by 2023, which could eliminate more than three million tons of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases emitted every year, the equivalent of approximately 650,000 cars taken off the road, the company said in a statement. This would be a fraction of the emissions resulting from using the oil itself. North America’s Building Trades Unions, which has frequently teamed up with the American Petroleum Institute to support oil and gas industry projects, said that fulfilling the renewable pledge would mean more jobs. TC Energy said it would contribute to a green energy job training program for building trades workers. The project has been mired in litigation for years, and opponents managed to slow its construction during Trump’s tenure through several lawsuits. In different cases in late December, three Nebraska judges weighing landowners’ claims about eminent domain ruled that TransCanada had “substantially and materially” changed the Keystone XL pipeline route since it was approved in 2017. As a result, they said, the company might need to reapply for a new route certification with the Nebraska Public Service Commission, a process that could take at least another several months. TC Energy has been seeking rights of way from reluctant landowners by invoking eminent domain laws, which allows the government to expropriate private property with compensation for owners. But about 100 landowners have refused to sign and have filed 144 lawsuits, and 225 appeals over 11 years, according to Brian Jorde, a lawyer for the landowners. Whose land is it? Ranchers fight back as TransCanada asserts eminent domain Two of the judges in the December cases also cited Biden’s pledge to stop the project as reason for halting all of TransCanada’s current eminent domain proceedings against Nebraska landowners. Separately, environmental groups last year also won a case in Montana federal court that effectively prevents the Army Corps of Engineers from using a special permit known as National 12 to fast-track approval of construction on hundreds of sensitive water and wetland crossings along the Keystone XL route. Jane Kleeb, founder of the anti-pipeline group Bold Nebraska, said that by stopping the pipeline, Biden would be “showing courage and empathy to the farmers, ranchers and Tribal Nations who have dealt with an ongoing threat that disrupted their lives for over a decade. Today marks healing, hope and a path for the clean energy that builds America back better.”",President-elect Biden to end Keystone XL pipeline in fight on climate change

As the president-elect gears up to cut greenhouse gas emissions and put more land off limits to development, his aides will have to spend months unwinding these policies unless congressional Democrats or federal judges overturn them. Every president rushes to lock in his agenda before leaving office: Bill Clinton protected tens of millions of acres of national forest from logging just before stepping down, and Barack Obama finalized a slew of rules on everything from energy efficiency to the disposal of toxic waste by dental offices. But Trump has managed to usher through an unusually large number of energy and environmental policies in just a single term, according to a Washington Post analysis, and has finalized more than two dozen since he lost the election in November. “Trump is the most anti-nature president in U.S. history, so it comes as no surprise that his administration is doubling down by selling off anything and everything before they leave office,” said Jenny Rowland-Shea, a senior policy analyst for public lands at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. “What we’re seeing right now is a last-ditch, desperate effort by the Trump administration to rubber-stamp as many permits, sign as many contracts and cut as many protected areas as it can to make a mess for the incoming Biden administration.” In the past week, for example, the Interior Department overturned an Obama-era measure that increased royalties that oil, gas and coal companies pay the federal government; cut 3.4 million acres in critical habitat for the northern spotted owl, which faces extinction; expedited approvals to lease more than 550,000 acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for energy development; and approved a four-lane highway through Utah’s Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, which had been permanently protected as a wildlife reserve 25 years ago. Interior also adopted language in its instructional manual on Monday requiring employees to use climate models that predict less-severe impacts from global warming, emphasizing “uncertainty” in the science. In an email, Interior Department spokesman Nicholas Goodwin said, “The Department continues to implement its mission and statutory obligations for the American people.” Trump leases more than half-a-million acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling The oil, gas and mining industries stand to gain the most from these final rule changes. On Friday, the Energy Department granted the natural gas industry’s petition to ensure less energy-efficient furnaces and water heaters remain on the market. The American Gas Association cheered the move for giving consumers more choices. But Andrew deLaski, executive director of the energy-efficiency advocacy group Appliance Standards Awareness Project, said it could lock in pollution for years to come from home heating, a big if underappreciated source of greenhouse gas emissions. “It’s a legal trick that is designed to tie the hands of the Biden administration,” he said. “This really matters for the climate.” The U.S. Forest Service on Friday issued a final environmental impact statement and draft decision that would pave the way for a subsidiary of two mining giants, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, to develop the Resolution Copper Mine on an area in Arizona’s Tonto National Forest that is sacred to the San Carlos Apache tribe. Also on Friday, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt signed an order to allow mineral leasing across 9.7 million acres in western Alaska, including on the Seward Peninsula and between the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and the Arctic Ocean. And the Environmental Protection Agency finalized a rule Tuesday that exempts oil refiners, steelmakers and landfills from future carbon emission limits. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement that the decision to exclude those industries “adheres to the specific requirement laid out in the Clean Air Act” that sectors contributing less than 3 percent of total gross greenhouse gas emissions nationally are not “significant” sources of pollution. David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council said that threshold is arbitrary and the decision could be legally vulnerable since it came “out of the blue,” without public comment. Federal judges will likely decide the fate of that and many other policies. In the case of the northern spotted owl, for example, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials determined last month that the Pacific Northwest’s iconic bird should be upgraded from threatened to endangered under the Endangered Species Act. But the agency declined to do that, citing resource constraints, and on Wednesday it cut the owl’s protected habitat by more than a third, to 3.4 million acres. Bernhardt and Interior Deputy Solicitor Karen Budd-Falen personally pushed for the move over the objections of agency scientists, according to two individuals familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations. As recently as August, officials indicated in court that they would scale back the habitat designation by 205,000 acres; the rule indicates Bernhardt exercised “his discretion” in expanding it. In a statement, Fish and Wildlife Service Director Aurelia Skipwith called the changes “common-sense revisions.” American Resource Forest Council President Travis Joseph, whose group challenged the Obama administration’s move to expand the owl’s protected habitat to 9.5 million acres in 2013, said in an interview that the decision reflected recent changes in the law and a 2018 Supreme Court decision. “This has been a 30-year conversation about balance in forest management, and frankly this is just the latest chapter,” he said. But Susan Jane Brown, staff attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center, said the secretary had overstepped his bounds given the fact that the northern spotted owl’s numbers are declining due to land clearing and other threats. “You don’t have that kind of discretion,” she said. Litigation is not the only route to overturning these decisions. Biden’s allies in Congress are already eyeing rules they can abolish under the Congressional Review Act, which nullifies regulations within 60 legislative days of enactment by a simple majority vote and the president’s signature. Democrats are considering using the law to reverse an EPA rule limiting the science it can use in crafting public health safeguards and one from the Treasury Department penalizing big banks that refuse to lend money for fossil-fuel operations. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said in an interview that they need to be careful because once repeal is enacted, the law prohibits issuing a rule that’s substantially similar to it. “Part of what we have to do is coordinate very tightly with the Biden administration,” he said. But it may take Democrats years to overturn some rollbacks. On Friday, the EPA formally abandoned plans kicked off under Obama to restrict the use of three toxic chemicals used to remove paint, degrease machine parts and remove spots through dry cleaning.  Richard Denison, a lead senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, said the agency’s decision to scrap the rest of the proposed restrictions “will make it hard for the Biden administration to resuscitate those actions.”","In Trump’s last days, a spree of environmental rollbacks"
222,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/15/french-oil-giant-total-quits-american-petroleum-institute/,WP,Towards Left,"French oil giant Total said Friday that it is quitting the American Petroleum Institute, becoming the first major petroleum company to leave the trade group. Total said it was acting in line with the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change and that it could not reconcile differences with API over carbon pricing, subsidies for electric vehicles and the regulation of methane emissions. “We are committed to ensuring, in a transparent manner, that the industry associations of which we are a member adopt positions and messages that are aligned with those of the Group in the fight against climate change,” Patrick Pouyanné, Total’s chief executive, said in a statement. Total also criticized API for supporting candidates during the recent U.S. elections who argued against U.S. participation in the Paris agreement. According to the Center for Responsive Politics’ Open Secrets website, API contributed to the campaigns of Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), all of whom applauded President Trump for withdrawing from the Paris agreement in 2017. API also gave to the Eye of the Tiger PAC, which is associated with Scalise. Total also pointed to API’s membership in the Transportation Fairness Alliance, which opposes subsidies for electric vehicles. “We believe that the world’s energy and environmental challenges are large enough that many different approaches are necessary to solve them, and we benefit from a diversity of views,"" API said in a statement issued Friday morning. ""We do not support subsidizing energy because it distorts the market and ultimately proves harmful to consumers."" The group said that ""our industry’s focus continues to be on taking meaningful action and shaping policy at all levels of government to reduce U.S. emissions and ensure access to affordable and reliable energy.” Earlier this week, API’s president Mike Sommers said in an annual address on energy that the trade group opposed EV subsidies. “We’ll oppose efforts to provide new subsides for the build out of electric vehicles and believe they should compete at same level we do,” he said. But Sommers said that the group would be “a willing partner” with the incoming Biden administration in talks on tougher regulation of methane emissions leaking from wells and pipelines. Total said that “API maintains its support for the rollback of U.S. regulation on methane emissions, which the Group opposed in November 2019.” Other major oil companies have quit trade groups, but have avoided leaving the influential API. BP, Shell and Total have already severed ties with the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, and BP has also exited the Western States Petroleum Association and the Western Energy Alliance.  BP cuts ties to three trade groups over climate policies Megan Baldino, head of corporate communications for BP America, said that the company continues to “actively monitor” its memberships in trade associations, “especially those we view as only ‘partially aligned’ with us on climate-related issues.” She said BP was “trying to influence those associations from within.” Total has invested $7 billion in the United States over the past five years and employs more than 7,000 people. It is active in U.S. projects that export liquefied natural gas and this year expects to become the largest LNG exporter in the United States. It also owns a refinery in Port Arthur, Tex. It holds minority stakes in three Gulf of Mexico fields, as well as onshore fields in the Barnett shale basin in Texas and the Utica basin in Ohio. The company says 10 percent of its capital spending is on renewable energy, and it owns a major stake in the U.S. firm SunPower.",French oil giant Total quits American Petroleum Institute
223,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/14/biden-climate-staff/,WP,Towards Left,"President-elect Joe Biden added more than a half-dozen climate staffers to his White House team Thursday, drawing from the ranks of green groups, environmental justice advocates and former Democratic administration officials to grow an inner circle that will help him try to slash the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions. The new hires include David J. Hayes, who served as Interior deputy secretary under Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama; Cecilia Martinez, a prominent environmental justice advocate based in Minneapolis who advised the transition team; and Stef Feldman, a top Biden campaign aide who helped craft his climate plan. They will work with several incoming Cabinet officials new to Biden’s orbit, including North Carolina environmental regulator Michael S. Regan, picked to run the Environmental Protection Agency, and Rep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), set to serve as interior secretary. The incoming White House team — which also includes former secretary of state John F. Kerry and former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy, along with Obama administration veterans in the National Security Council and the White House Counsel’s Office — represents the most robust climate-focused group assembled in the West Wing. “These qualified, diverse and experienced appointees share the president and vice president-elect’s view that there is no greater challenge facing our country and our world than climate change,” the transition team said in a statement. “From marshaling every part of our government, working directly with communities, and harnessing the forces of science these appointees will be instrumental in utilizing all the tools at the incoming administration’s disposal to address climate change head on.” Biden, set to take office in less than a week, will try to execute a far-reaching strategy to embed climate action across government agencies and in legislation on Capitol Hill. He has also pledged to address the disproportionate pollution burden carried by poor and minority neighborhoods. In a recent interview, John Podesta, who helped spearhead Obama’s second-term climate agenda as senior counselor to the president, noted that Biden has assembled more expertise on the subject than any of his predecessors. When Obama first came into office, he brought on former EPA chief Carol Browner as a senior climate adviser with just minimal staff. Podesta also operated informally during his time in the White House, using long-established relationships and his access to the president as a way to mobilize action in several departments. Now, Podesta said, the president-elect is building out the White House staff on both the international and domestic sides. “It shows how central climate change is to Biden’s foreign and security policy, just as it is to his domestic and economic policy,” he said.  Biden wants to ban all new drilling on public lands and waters. Here's why that's hard to do. Martinez will play a major role in tackling pollution disparities as senior director for environmental justice at the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). In an interview in July, Martinez said addressing the acute impact poor and minority neighborhoods often face from pollution needs to be “a central focus of CEQ.” The Biden administration’s initiative on environmental justice “needs to really have some teeth to it so that the different federal agencies not only develop their plans and collaborate, but there is accountability,” she added. Martinez is a newcomer to Washington but the new lineup includes some longtime bureaucratic veterans such as Hayes, who will serve as special assistant to the president for climate policy. Hayes spearheaded Interior’s renewable energy development plans and its efforts to address climate change impacts in the Arctic under Obama, before joining the New York School of Law’s State Energy and Environmental Impact Center. From that perch, he helped organize several legal challenges by Democratic attorneys general to the Trump administration’s deregulatory agenda. Maggie Thomas, a former climate adviser to two of Biden’s former rivals for the presidency, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), will serve as chief of staff in the Office of Domestic Climate Policy. Thomas helped found a green group, Evergreen Action, which pushed Democrats to adopt pieces of Inslee’s comprehensive climate plan and lent policy chops to the burgeoning youth climate movement. Feldman, a longtime Biden aide who started as his policy intern when he was vice president and rose to become his 2020 campaign’s policy director, will serve as deputy assistant to Biden. During the presidential race, she helped get the buy-in of young climate activists, union leaders, environmental justice advocates and former Democratic rivals when writing Biden’s proposal to eliminate carbon pollution from the electric sector by 2035 and to spend $2 trillion over four years to boost clean energy. Jeff Marootian, who directs the D.C. Department of Transportation, will also join the White House and help oversee future hires as special assistant to the president for climate and science agency personnel. In recent days, Biden has also announced the return to the White House of two Obama-era officials who worked on energy and climate issues: Melanie Nakagawa, a former aide to Kerry at the State Department, and Megan Ceronsky, a former special assistant and associate counsel to Obama.

224,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/13/new-orange-bat/,WP,Towards Left,"Nancy Simmons was sitting in her office at the American Museum of Natural History two years ago when she got a startling text from a research expedition in Africa. It was a picture of a bat. But not just any bat. This one was orange with striking black wings, like an ambassador for Halloween. It was also fluffy with big pointy ears. And one more thing: It was new, never seen, discovered by a research crew sleuthing in caves on a mountain range on the border of the Ivory Coast and Guinea searching for an entirely different species of bat. “Wow, this is really cool,” said Simmons, a curator at the New York museum. Like Jon Flanders, the director of endangered species intervention at Bat Conservation International who sent the picture from the other side of the world, she didn’t quite know what to make of it. Simmons flipped through a bunch of books, looking at pictures of similar bats all over the world. It took two years to determine that Myotis nimbaensis, named for the Nimba Mountains where it was discovered, was in fact a new species. The confirmation was published Wednesday in the journal American Museum Novitates. At a time when the United Nations has warned of a biodiversity crisis, with 1 million species facing extinction, a find such as this is greeted as a light in a dark era, Bat Conservation International said in a statement. “From a biodiversity standpoint, it’s mostly gloom and doom so it’s always good to have feel-good story,” Flanders said. It’s possible that Myotis nimbaensis is only the second bat species found in those mountains, called sky islands because they sit within a wide expanse of lowlands. The study was part of an ongoing effort to help the Nimba Mountain bats survive, Bat Conservation International said. About 20 new bat species are found each year, experts said, but they don’t often look like this new bat. “The color is just phenomenal,” Flanders said. “Its wings are black with these orange fingers. There aren’t a lot orange bats in the world. I don’t tend to work with that many brightly colored bats. It’s definitely an unusual one for me.” Flanders and his expedition of eight researchers went to the mountains, where the bats roost in mines that were carved into them. The mines are old and too unstable to enter, so the team tossed nets across the entrance to catch bats as they flew out. With the Société des Mines de Fer de Guinéa, a mining company, Bat Conservation is working to build new tunnels that bats can use when the old pathways collapse. The mission was to find the critically endangered Lamotte’s roundleaf bat. But peering into the net at the black roundleaf bats in the black night, Flanders and another member of the expedition, Eric Moïse Bakwo Fils from the University of Maroua, noticed something unusual. “I looked in a net and there was just something interesting in there,” Flanders said. “Eric and I got back to camp and we independently started trying to figure out what the hell was going on. Finding a new species of specially colored bats is very rare. I was like, ‘I’m pretty sure this is a new species’. We walked in the room in the morning and simultaneously said ‘I think we’ve got a new species.’ ” It was Simmons’s job to be sure. “I ended up going to the Smithsonian and the British Museum of Natural History for an analysis of the tissue sample to look at the DNA,” Simmons said. “A lot of bats in Africa haven’t been surveyed. To document that this was a new species we had to look very carefully across Africa and compare it to others.” Researchers spent years looking at bats to determine different fur colors, patterns on spiky wings, spots and discoloration on faces. There are other bats as orange as ripe mangoes, in China and South America, but they differ significantly from each other, and certainly from more common black bats. “It’s rare for someone to go out in the field and find a striking, gorgeous animal that’s new,” Simmons said. “These bats are found only in this area atop the Nimba Mountains. They could have gone extinct and no one would have ever known.”",A new bat was discovered in Africa — and it’s orange and black like Halloween

Snyder, his former health department director Nick Lyon and former adviser Rich Baird were among those notified by the office of Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel (D) of the pending indictments and advised to expect imminent court dates, the AP reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the prosecution. The nature of the criminal charges were not immediately clear.  Randall L. Levine, an attorney representing Baird, confirmed in a statement to the Post Tuesday that authorities notified him this week about indictments. He said Baird “will be facing charges stemming from his work helping to restore safe drinking water for all residents and faith in the community where he grew up.” But he added that Baird had not yet “been made aware of what the charges are, or how they are related to his position with former Michigan Governor Rick Snyder’s administration."" Courtney Covington, a spokeswoman for Nessel’s office, told The Washington Post that the office’s investigators were still working “diligently” and declined to comment on the probe or confirm reports that charges are imminent. Brian Lennon, an attorney for Snyder, blasted the reported charges as a “smear campaign.” “It is outrageous to think any criminal charges would be filed against Gov. Snyder,” Lennon said in Tuesday statement in which he characterized any such action against the former governor as “meritless” and politically motivated. ‘If I could afford to leave, I would.’ In Flint, a water crisis with no end in sight. Separately, Chip Chamberlain, an attorney for Lyon, said in a statement Tuesday that criminal charges against his client “would be an absolute travesty of justice.” He added that previous charges filed against Lyon in 2017 “were politically motivated and meritless, and after two years of baseless claims and personal attacks they were dismissed.” Nessel’s office dropped all criminal charges in the case in 2019, shortly after she took office, effectively restarting the probe. Mona Hanna-Attisha, the pediatrician whose research in 2015 first documented dangerously high lead levels in children’s blood, welcomed news of the reported charges. “As a pediatrician privileged to care for our Flint children, I have increasingly come to understand that accountability and justice are critical to health and recovery,” Hanna-Attisha told The Post in a text message Tuesday. “Without justice, it’s impossible to heal the scars of the crisis.” Hanna-Attisha, director of pediatric residency at the Hurley Children’s Hospital in Flint, warned that while the news was a salve for the many families whose lives had been affected by the poisoned water, criminal charges are only part of the story. “I am hopeful this news serves as a reminder of Flint’s lessons; where the perfect storm of environmental injustice, indifferent bureaucracy, lost democracy & austerity, compounded by decades of racism & deindustrialization left a city powerless & forgotten,” she said. “Never again should this country have to deal with the generational repercussions of a community poisoned by policies.” Flint’s lead-poisoned water had a ‘horrifyingly large’ effect on fetal deaths, study finds The early days of the crisis trace back to April 2014, when Flint switched its water supply to the Flint River in a cost-savings stopgap measure until a permanent pipeline project was complete. After the switch, Flint residents immediately complained about the water’s odor and appearance, eventually reporting health issues such as skin rashes. Even as complaints persisted for months, the city still advised residents that the water was safe. A dozen people died of a Legionnaire’s outbreak in 2014 amid the crisis, though a 2019 investigation found that the death toll was probably much higher. “Residents of Flint were repeatedly told they were crazy. They were belittled. They were harmed by the water physically, emotionally,” Michigan Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich (D-Flint) said in an interview Tuesday. “I’ve always said that I think criminal charges are important, because I think it’s criminal what happened to my town.” Ananich emphasized that he doesn’t know the extent of the charges expected later this week, but he does hope they send a clear message: “No person, no politician, no one is above the law.” For Flint families who continue to live with the irreversible effects of the tainted water, Tuesday’s news symbolized a level of vindication. “I can’t believe it,” Gina Luster, a Flint community activist, told The Post in a message. “Finally, after 7 years of fighting for justice.” Reacting to the news via Facebook, Luster added an emoji: The scales of justice.",Report: Ex-Mich. governor Rick Snyder to face criminal charges in Flint water crisis

227,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/12/trump-epa-scott-pruitt/,WP,Towards Left,"The Environmental Protection Agency will host the official portrait unveiling Friday of former chief Scott Pruitt, who resigned in 2018 after coming under scrutiny for his lavish travel and treatment of staff, along with his ties to lobbyists and outside groups. A small group of family, friends and former colleagues will attend the ceremony, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in an interview Tuesday. The portrait, which consists of a framed photo transferred to canvas, cost taxpayers $4,513. EPA officials noted that the total bill is less than what it cost to frame the photographic portrait of Pruitt’s predecessor, Gina McCarthy, who served in the Obama administration and is slated to join the incoming Biden administration as the first-ever national climate adviser. “You know, Gina McCarthy, she had a big event for hers,” Wheeler said. “It’s up to each administrator, what kind of event that they want for the portrait unveiling.” Pruitt could not be reached for comment Tuesday. E&E News reported some details about the unveiling ceremony Tuesday afternoon. Trump's rolled back more than 125 environmental policies. Here's how. Asked how he would define the mark Pruitt left on the agency, Wheeler said: “You know, Scott and I only overlapped eight weeks. So I think it’s too soon to speak to his overall legacy.” But he added that Pruitt — who set in motion several of the Trump administration’s highest-profile environmental rollbacks on issues ranging from climate pollution to toxic waste from power plants before leaving in 2018 under a cloud of ethics inquiries — did elevate the importance of Superfund cleanups and pushed to more quickly finalize national air quality standards. The portrait will not be the only lasting physical reminder of Pruitt’s legacy. Nearby, just steps from the EPA administrator’s office, stands the secure phone booth he installed, which violated federal spending laws and cost taxpayers $43,000. Pruitt ultimately made a single call to the White House from the private booth. Wheeler said that at this point, it would make sense to keep the well-publicized booth in place, given the amount of money spent to reinforce the floor to support it. “So I think when they started the project they had no idea what they were getting into. … You know, once you start a project you can’t bail in the middle because you have all these sunk costs,” he explained. “It may be expensive to remove it at this point.”",EPA to unveil Scott Pruitt’s portrait Friday
228,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2021/01/12/climate-science-moms/,WP,Towards Left,"“What world have I brought my child into?” the new mom pleaded. “What can I do to make sure my baby isn’t brought up in a world that’s being destroyed?” It was 2019, and climate researcher Katharine Hayhoe was at a church breakfast in Fairbanks, Alaska, when a young woman tapped on her shoulder and confessed that she was terrified. Ever since the birth of her daughter, the young woman said, she couldn’t stop worrying about the threat of a rapidly warming planet. “That heartfelt question is one I thought I could only really answer as a fellow mom,” said Hayhoe, an atmospheric scientist at Texas Tech University and an evangelical Christian who has spent years trying to educate the public about climate change. Hayhoe told the Alaska woman the same thing she sometimes had to tell herself when she worried about her own son’s future: Channel your fear into action. Talk to your friends and family. Advocate for change in your town, your church, your school, your state. Now, Hayhoe aims to replicate that exchange on a much bigger scale. Along with five fellow climate scientists who are also mothers, she has teamed up with Potential Energy, a nonprofit marketing firm, to launch Science Moms, a $10 million campaign to educate and empower mothers to do something about climate change. Advertisements featuring Hayhoe and the female scientists will air on national TV and online for the next month. The initial push will be followed by ads in several key states where the effects of climate change are already being felt, including North Carolina, Arizona and Wisconsin. Organizers said it’s the beginning of a multiyear effort. In one video, Colorado State University atmospheric scientist Melissa Burt narrates a montage of images of her 4-year-old daughter, Mia, juxtaposed with footage of a hurricane. “You don’t have to be a climate scientist to want to protect the Earth,” she says. “And for Mia, I want you to know that I worked really hard to be a part of the change and to make it a better place for you.” The campaign also has a website featuring facts and resources, including links to books on talking to kids about climate and a form for contacting elected officials. “One of the most powerful ways for us to connect over climate change is … this fundamental value that we share,” Hayhoe said. “We all want to ensure a better and safer future for our child.” Mothers are the “sweet spot” for inspiring social change, said John Marshall, a veteran marketing executive and consultant and a founder of Potential Energy. They have a long track record of political activity: Mothers Against Drunk Driving helped lower the legal limit for blood alcohol content in drivers. Moms Demand Action has lobbied for initiatives to prevent gun violence. Politicians prize their votes; corporations go after their pocketbooks. They are also disproportionately likely to say they are already concerned about climate change, making it easier to move them to act. “A dollar spent on a concerned mom goes a lot further than a lot of other segments,” Marshall said. Climate change raises the risk from failing sewage systems. Catherine Coleman Flowers is working for a new way to deal with waste. But his research suggests that mothers are not more vocal about the warming threat because they’re not confident they understand the science and are unsure of what to do about it. That’s where Science Moms comes in. “Moms trust moms,” said Burt. She hopes that viewers will see her — a Black woman who studies the warming Arctic and presents at scientific conferences but also cooks spaghetti for her family and gardens with her daughter — and feel represented. “I want to connect with moms who look like me,” she said. “Black moms and Brown moms, and moms who are in communities of color, because we are disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change.” “I just want other moms who look like me to know they have a role in combating this crisis,” she added. Science Moms is funded through donations, including large gifts from philanthropist MacKenzie Scott and former Nature Conservancy chief executive Mark Tercek. The group says it will be the biggest educational awareness campaign around climate since Al Gore’s $100 million ad blitz about the issue in 2007. Science Moms is a 501(c)(3), which means the group cannot engage in political campaigns or seek to influence legislation. Marshall will measure success in heightened awareness of the threat posed by global warming and increased willingness to take action. He said his aim is to double the proportion of Americans who say they are “alarmed” about climate change — a number that hovers around 26 percent, according to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “That’s really low,” he said. “If you were an alien and looked at the planet, you’d think, ‘How could only a quarter of people be concerned about this?’ ” Hayhoe hopes the ads will help counter the climate misinformation and misconceptions that so many Americans are exposed to: claims that it only affects polar bears (weather-related disasters cost the United States $95 billion and killed more than 200 people last year); assertions that the climate is always changing (in 4.6 billion years it has never warmed this fast); accusations that other countries are more at fault (the United States is the largest historical source of planet-warming emissions). These misconceptions persist even though scientists are the second most-trusted “messengers” on climate, according to the Yale center, Hayhoe pointed out. “What we want to do is empower other moms to become messengers in the most-trusted category, which is friends and family,” she said. “I really believe that using our voices is the way we can make a difference.”",Female scientists focus on a secret weapon to fight climate change: Moms
229,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2021/01/12/climate-solutions-united-airlines/?itid=sf_climate-environment,WP,Towards Left,"United Airlines is investing in a venture that doesn’t make airplanes, transport passengers or ring up frequent-flier miles on the company’s credit cards. And even as it posts losses stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, United is providing millions of dollars to that venture, which has no direct ties to aviation and may not make any money. It is backing carbon capture — the nascent technology designed to suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. United Airlines is the first major U.S. air carrier to take a step toward trying to remove some of the greenhouse gases spewed by it and every other airline, pollution that is driving up global temperatures. For United, it’s an alluring project. Governments, particularly in Europe, are beginning to crack down on emissions from airlines. Last month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the first time regulated greenhouse gas emissions from commercial aircraft, although environmental groups say the rules are so lax as to not make a difference. United is increasingly focused on its voluntary goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 — good publicity at a time of growing alarm about climate change. America has a dirty secret. And climate change is making it worse. But it may also be placing an early bet that carbon-capture technology could — with the help of federal tax credits — prove profitable as the globe races for ways to cut the pollution that threatens the planet. “This crisis will end,” United chief executive Scott Kirby wrote on Medium last month, referring to the pandemic. “That’s why we’re keeping our focus on another crisis that will force all of us to change our behavior in far more dramatic ways than the pandemic ever did: the crisis of a changing climate. The longer we wait, the more drastic those changes will have to be.” United has declined to say how much it is investing. Steve Oldham, chief executive of Carbon Engineering, which has developed carbon-capture technology, said United is taking an unusual approach to decarbonization. “When most are thinking they have to stop emissions, here you have a very credible company with a real need saying that the best way of dealing with emissions is removing them,” he said. A lot is at stake. If global airlines were lumped together as one country, they would rank among the world’s top five or six emitters of carbon dioxide, according to the International Energy Agency. Aviation accounts for 3.5 percent of the planet’s man-made greenhouse gas emissions, a recent Manchester Metropolitan University study says. At high altitudes, the planes leave behind contrails of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, water vapor and soot. When it comes to commercial aviation, there are no low-carbon alternatives. In the summer, a small white-and-red all-electric-powered Cessna e-Caravan flew safely  over Washington state — for only 28 minutes. The plane had room for nine, but only the pilot was on board. The first commercial-grade, zero-emission airplane to fly in Europe took off in 2020. Solar-powered flights are even less practical. A plane called Solar Impulse 2 went around the world over 14 months, but it could only hold the pilot in an unheated, unpressurized phone-booth-size cockpit whose single seat doubled as a toilet. The plane flew at an average of 30 miles per hour to maximize energy savings, and, despite an enormous wingspan, it was only able to carry the equivalent weight of one automobile. “The aviation sector is one of the hardest to decarbonize,” Oldham said. “Planes require fuel and burn a lot of fuel. At high altitude, the impact of those carbon emissions is greater than if they were released on the surface.” So United says it will become a partner in 1PointFive, a joint venture designed to finance and deploy a large-scale direct-air-capture plant. The firm, formed in August by a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum and Rusheen Capital Management, will use technology created by Carbon Engineering. A climate solution slowly gains ground The name 1PointFive refers to the U.N. goal of limiting the average increase in global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared with preindustrial times. Constraining global warming to that level could avert the most catastrophic fallout from climate change, scientists say. The company will build its first plant somewhere in the Texas Permian Basin, an area rich in shale crude oil and natural gas. Occidental, the biggest oil and gas operator in the Permian, will take the carbon dioxide from the air and pump it into old wells to extract more oil. Legislation gives firms a $35-a-barrel tax credit for this capture and use. Occidental will leave the carbon dioxide underground; it has said it has enough geologic storage capacity to bury 28 years worth of U.S. emissions. But extracting more oil from underground doesn’t please climate activists, although the money will help 1PointFive cover Carbon Engineering’s estimated cost of $100 for each ton of carbon dioxide captured. “It’s not a new business model. It’s just thinking about carbon as an asset, not a waste product,” said Jim McDermott, co-founder and managing partner of Rusheen. He said 1PointFive plans to ultimately build 27 plants. Even with that ambition, scale remains a problem. United has improved its fuel efficiency by more than 45 percent since 1990, the year often used as a benchmark for climate-oriented energy savings. It has added aerodynamic fins on wingtips, used only one engine when taxiing on runways and bought planes that weigh less. But the number of travelers has soared, and airline fuel consumption has gone up. The federal Energy Information Administration estimates that jet fuel demand will more than double by 2050. Each carbon-capture plant will take up about 100 acres and capture 1 million tons, equivalent to the work of more than 40 million trees. To put that into perspective, worldwide emissions are 40 gigatons. Offsetting that would require 40,000 carbon capture plants. It’s a daunting number, though Oldham says that it’s no more than the number of power and industrial plants around the world. And it would be a major jobs program. In his campaign position paper, President-elect Joe Biden said he would “double down” on federal investments and tax incentives to bring carbon capture technology to market. There aren’t many companies working on technology to capture carbon dioxide directly from the air. Those that do have been signing up partners — albeit at a modest pace, far less than the speed needed to have an impact on global climate change. One other company that says it is getting off the ground is Global Thermostat, which makes smaller installations that are the size of a shipping container but can be deployed in a variety of settings. Global Thermostat says it has a deal to provide carbon dioxide — the fizz in soft drinks — to Coca-Cola FEMSA, a Mexican firm that is Coke’s largest bottling franchise. The amount has not been disclosed. Saudi Aramco is close to signing a deal with Global Thermostat to capture carbon dioxide, add hydrogen and make synthetic gasoline. A Saudi water desalination company is also looking at Global Thermostat as a potential carbon dioxide source for its operations. And ExxonMobil has paid several million dollars for the second straight year to expand a joint development agreement with Global Thermostat, whose work “has shown promising signs,” Vijay Swarup, vice president of research and development at ExxonMobil, said in a statement. Time, however, is pressing. United aircraft burned 3.56 billion gallons of fuel in 2019, generating 34.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and equivalent greenhouse gases, the company said. It is one of the nation’s four largest carriers, with an approximately 15 percent market share. This isn’t the first foray United has made to rectify its greenhouse gas emissions. The carrier has invested $30 million in Fulcrum BioEnergy, which makes aviation fuel from biological waste. United said the fuel has up to 80 percent less life cycle carbon emissions than conventional jet fuel, and that it remains the fastest and most effective way to reduce its emissions. But it cannot be made in large enough quantities to cover all of the airline’s demands and is generally limited to 10 percent of a plane’s fuel mix. In 2019, United committed $40 million toward an initiative focused on accelerating the development of other sustainable aviation fuels and other decarbonization technologies. That is still not enough. A United Nations agency called the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, or CORSIA, wants airlines to stabilize CO2 emissions at 2020 levels. Any growth of their emissions would need to be offset by buying credits generated by projects that reduce emissions in other sectors such as renewable energy. CORSIA’s edicts will become mandatory for most countries, including the United States, in 2027. Test your knowledge about the climate with our quiz United has also considered — and rejected — any plan to buy and sell credits on new climate securities markets and use them to offset the company’s emissions. “While they may offer customers some peace of mind, traditional carbon offsets do almost nothing to tackle the emissions from flying,” Kirby, chief executive of United Airlines, said in a column online. “And, more importantly, they simply don’t meet the scale of this global challenge.” By contrast, he said, “sequestration is a real and permanent solution.” David Victor, a professor and climate expert at the University of California at San Diego, said, “If you’re United, you need to be a global operator, and there are parts of the world that are moving very rapidly to net [zero] emissions.” Other airlines are just starting to invest in different options, he said. Airbus, for example, has plans for a hydrogen-powered prototype. So far, however, the projects are in elementary stages. “The airlines are an example of a sector where firms are starting to see the writing on the wall,” Victor said. “And a lot of them don’t know what to do.” Chris Mooney contributed to this report.",United Airlines aims to suck carbon dioxide from the friendly skies

231,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/11/invasive-hippos-escobar-colombia-castrate/,WP,Towards Left,"It was hard enough to find the hippo, a massive, ornery male with a reputation for harassing local ranchers. For three long months, the scientists tracked it through the Colombian countryside, staking out lakes, traipsing through brush and camping on nearby farms. But castrating it — that was an almost herculean task. They had to inject it with a potent elephant tranquilizer before it was safe to approach. Even with the hippo immobilized, it was surprisingly difficult to locate his, ahem, parts. “It was horrible,” recalled David Echeverri Lopez, a researcher at the regional environmental agency Cornare who led the 2013 sterilization effort. “You cannot just go on the Internet and Google, ‘What to do with a hippopotamus?’” After all, the creature belonged on the other side of the ocean, in the savannas and forests of sub-Saharan Africa. But in the 1980s, drug kingpin Pablo Escobar smuggled four hippos onto his private country estate. Now dozens of its wild spawn roam the wetlands north of Bogota, the largest invasive species on the planet. Locals see the hippos as an unofficial mascot. But to scientists, they are an ecological menace, competing with native wildlife and polluting local waterways. Occasionally, they have even attacked humans. Now a study forecasts that the invasive hippo population will swell to almost 1,500 individuals by 2040. At that point, their environmental impacts will be irreversible and their numbers impossible to control. Something needs to be done — and soon. In the beginning, there were only four hippos. How much trouble could they cause? So reasoned Colombian officials charged with dismantling Escobar’s sprawling country estate after his death in 1993. They were reluctant to approach the animals, each highly aggressive and roughly the size and weight of a four-door sedan. While most of the drug lord’s exotic animals were sent to zoos, the hippos — three females and one male — were allowed to roam. That was the first mistake. In their natural habitat, hippos spend the long dry season crowded into waterways that have shrunk to puddles. There, they are vulnerable to disease and predation — not to mention one another’s bad tempers. But tropical Colombia is “hippo paradise,” Echeverri said. Rain is abundant, food is plentiful and there are no carnivores large enough to pose a threat. The animals spend five hours a day grazing on grasses and the rest of their time basking in the cool waters of the Magdalena River and surrounding lakes. Whereas most African communities are justifiably leery of hippos — the creatures kill more people annually than any other large mammal — their Colombian neighbors are captivated by them. Gift shops in nearby Puerto Triunfo sell hippo keychains and T-shirts. At the amusement park that was built on the site of Escobar’s former pleasure palace, visitors can tour the lake where several dozen hippos now live. Occasionally, one will plod into a nearby community, looking as blasé as a shopper on his way to the grocery store. “The hippopotamus is the town pet,” resident Claudia Patricia Camacho told the news program Noticias Caracol in 2018. “You could say that he now takes to the street as if they were his own.” Yet human-hippo interactions aren’t usually friendly. In 2009, after a trio of escapees from Hacienda Napoles were reported terrorizing local farms, Colombia’s environmental agency sent a team of hunters after the animals with an order to shoot on sight. But then a photo emerged showing the soldiers posing with the carcass of one of the adults, named Pepe. Animal rights activists denounced the killing; “They could have been captured and kept in a safe place until a permanent refuge was found for them,” Marcela Ramirez, a member of the local Animal Protection Network, told Reuters at the time. A judge issued a ruling suspending the hunt for Pepe’s mate and offspring, and it became illegal to kill hippos in the country. That’s when Echeverri launched his sterilization campaign. After their early, exhausting effort to track an animal in the wild, the team decided to try corralling one. They piled carrots and fruit in the center of a wooden pen and waited for a hungry hippo to stroll through. “But the corral didn’t work,” Echeverri said, speaking in Spanish over Zoom. “When he felt like he was enclosed, he jumped,” crushing the wooden barrier and escaping into the trees. He added, “I didn’t know they could jump.” Though male hippos have what scientists politely term “spatially dynamic testes” (their genitalia is retractable, and can hide in an opening called the inguinal canal), females’ reproductive organs proved even harder to find. “We didn’t understand the female anatomy,” Echeverri said. “We tried to do it on several occasions and were always unsuccessful.” Eventually he found the answer: Trap the hippo in a pen. Make sure the walls are high. Don’t bother with the females. But the process remains dangerous, time consuming and costly, especially for his low-budget agency. Echeverri is able to castrate roughly one hippo per year, whereas scientists estimate that the population grows by 10 percent annually. Last year, a rancher was caught by surprise while collecting water; the hippo bit his leg and threw him into the air, breaking his leg, hip and a number of ribs. A 2020 study of hippo-inhabited lakes found that nutrients in the animals’ feces were fueling huge blooms of bacteria and algae. These in turn reduced the oxygen content of the water, making it toxic to fish. “We saw oxygen levels that were getting to levels where you would expect to see fish start to go belly up,” said Jonathan Shurin, an ecologist at the University of California at San Diego who has worked with Echeverri to evaluate the hippos’ environmental impacts. There is concern that this will affect the region’s fishing industry. In Africa, hippos act as ecosystem engineers, transferring nutrients from land to lakes and sculpting new channels for water as they tread across dry earth. Some researchers have suggested they could provide a similar service in their new home. They might even fill the environmental niche left by massive mammals that went extinct after the Ice Age: giant llamas, a rhino relative called Toxodon. But Nataly Castelblanco-Martínez, a Colombian ecologist working at the University of Quintana Roo in Mexico, was skeptical of this hypothesis. Colombia’s lakes and rivers are already home to large native mammals. Giant, guinea-pig-like capybaras feed on the grasses and fruits now consumed by hippos. Threatened Antillean manatees may be crowded out of their habitat by the aggressive newcomers. Management of the hippo problem takes resources away from Colombia’s hundreds of endangered animals, Castelblanco-Martínez said. It also distracts officials from dealing with the roughly 400 invasive species that threaten native ecosystems. Animal rights activists “are concerned only for the hippo,” she continued. “They are missing the whole picture: the social picture, the economic picture, and the ecological picture, too.” Castelblanco-Martínez is the lead author on the new population study, published this month in the journal Biological Conservation. Using statistical models and climate projections, her team found that the hippos were on track to meet the ecosystem’s carrying capacity — about 1,418 animals — by 2039. Officials would have to increase the pace of sterilizations to about 30 per year, half of them in females, to have any effect. Even then, it would simply delay the point at which the hippos consumed all the food and space available to them. “The only efficient strategy to deal with the invasion,” Castelblanco-Martínez and her colleagues wrote, was “extraction” of 30 hippos per year, starting right now. There’s no obvious place to put them. Puerto Triunfo has for years sought zoos willing to take the hippos, to no avail. No African nation would risk their own hippo population by reintroducing dozens of animals with mysterious origins and unknown behaviors. The scientists say Colombia must consider a cull. “Nobody likes the idea of shooting a hippo. I do not like it,” Castelblanco-Martínez said. “But no other strategy is going to work.” This is what happens, she said, when a society fails to act on a problem until it becomes too dire to ignore. Relocation might have been feasible 30 years ago, when there were only four hippos. Castration could have been effective if officials had provided sufficient resources for the program early on. Now the sole remaining option is the most painful one. Echeverri is less certain that killing the hippos is the only way to go. “These are animals who have turned themselves into an emblem for a whole community of people,” he said. “It’s not possible to just take them away.” He suggested it might be possible to sterilize or relocate the 50 or so hippos in the lake near Hacienda Napoles, and only cull those that have wandered farther afield. The U.S. nonprofit Animal Balance is collecting donations to help pay for this effort. But he agreed that time is running out to act. “I’ve worked for many years to understand the problem and find solutions, but the problem keeps happening over and over again,” Echeverri said. “The only thing that changes is the number of hippos.” Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the manatee species affected by the growing hippo population. They are Antillean manatees.",Invasion of the hippos: Colombia is running out of time to tackle Pablo Escobar’s wildest legacy
232,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/07/biden-climate-senate/,WP,Towards Left,"With Democrats poised to take control of Congress, the prospects for President-elect Joe Biden to pursue more aggressive policies to tackle climate change and other major environmental problems have expanded overnight. Even the thinnest Democratic majorities will enable Biden to press for much more generous federal support for renewable energy, environmentally friendly infrastructure, expanded tax breaks for electric vehicles and stricter energy-efficiency standards. Democratic control of Congress will make it easier for Biden to reverse some of President Trump’s rollbacks of environmental protections and to win confirmation for political appointees across the U.S. government who can shift policy toward a greener future. But with razor-thin margins in both chambers of Congress, the incoming administration will still have to navigate the demands of climate activists who expect Biden to live up to his bold environmental promises and the reality of a Senate split 50-50, with ties broken by a Democratic vice president. “The change in Senate leadership and committee leadership will place climate change and clean energy legislation and oversight much higher on the agenda,” Scott Segal, a lobbyist at the law firm Bracewell, which represents an array of energy-related companies. But he added, “Given the narrow margin of leadership in both the House and Senate, there still isn’t much in the way of open-field running for comprehensive climate change legislation.” With days left in office, Trump leases Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling The pressure Biden is likely to face — even within his own party — to move quickly and forcefully was already on display earlier this week. On Tuesday night, before either of the two Georgia Senate races had been called for Democrats, the Sunrise Movement’s New York chapter threatened to target Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) — now poised to become majority leader — if he didn’t pass clean energy legislation right away. “Hey heyy @SenSchumer, 15 days until you get to pass legislation for 100% renewable electricity by 2035! Either that or we picket your building allll the time,” read a tweet by the group, which represents young climate activists. Jamal Raad, co-founder of the liberal climate group Evergreen Action, agreed that activists will be pushing the Biden administration and Democratic lawmakers to follow through on their campaign promises. “We’ll give them some time, but we do expect them to pursue an aggressive climate agenda,” Raad said in an interview Wednesday. “A lot of people voted for this, and we have a moral responsibility to meet what the science demands on this issue.” But overall, he added, the fact that the Senate is now blue is “a good problem to have.” Biden will have a better shot at getting the $2 trillion in climate-focused investments he proposed during the campaign, as well as more quickly staffing key positions at the Environmental Protection Agency, Interior Department, Treasury and other posts, Raad said. “Those folks can more quickly get to the job of pursuing the all-of-government approach to climate that Biden has laid out,” he said. “We have window here to act. This could be a historic presidency in that respect.” Business groups, however, plan to rely on conservative Democrats and Republicans’ use of the legislative maneuver known as the filibuster to block climate legislation they oppose. The filibuster requires 60 votes to cut off debate and pass a bill. There is some debate among Democrats about whether to end the filibuster, which would mean legislation could pass by a simple majority. But Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), a key swing vote, recently said in a television interview that he wants to maintain the filibuster. With 50 Democratic votes in the Senate, the Biden administration could use a procedure known as reconciliation to squeeze through climate measures that are connected to the tax code or mandatory spending, though Biden isn’t likely to seek tax increases for some time given the ailing economy. Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, said he was “confident we’ll be able to continue to work on both sides of the aisle.” The oil and gas industry is most concerned about any effort by a Biden administration to halt drilling leases on federal lands and waters, as well as other issues such as tax credits for electric vehicles, he said. How Joe Biden’s surprisingly ambitious climate plan came together Even as they are likely to focus immediately on a coronavirus relief package, Democrats could soon seek to pass Biden’s massive “Build Back Better” plan aimed at eliminating carbon pollution from the electric sector by 2035, boosting renewables and creating incentives for more energy-efficient cars, homes and commercial buildings. Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters, said in an interview that he expected Democrats will go further than the Obama administration on climate and the environment. “The beauty of the Build Back Better plan,” he said, is that Biden has advocated for 40 percent of the funding to go to disadvantaged communities and areas likely to lose jobs in a clean energy transition, such as West Virginia and states in the Rust Belt. “There’s no reason for the Biden administration to scale back an ambitious plan. It makes sense, and it’s wildly popular,” he said. The stock market got a bounce Wednesday from the Georgia election results and optimism about further climate policies. Shares of First Solar, a solar panel manufacturer, and of Vestas Wind Systems, a Danish wind turbine manufacturer, each jumped more than 8 percent on news of the Democratic victories. One major legislative priority for Schumer will be tackling the country’s biggest source of carbon emissions — transportation. On Wednesday, the EPA reported that for the first time in five years, the overall fuel efficiency of the U.S. auto fleet fell and pollution increased. Under President Barack Obama, U.S. automakers had pledged to increase their average gas mileage by 5 percent each year. For years, Schumer has pushed for passage of a massive tax credit for the purchase of electric cars to discourage motorists from using gasoline-powered cars by 2040. Biden included Schumer’s proposal for a juiced-up electric vehicle rebate in his sweeping climate plan. Rich Powell, who heads the conservative-leaning energy group ClearPath, said broad bipartisan support exists for energy innovations such as better batteries or techniques for capturing carbon dioxide from the air. “We need to build stuff faster, cheaper and cleaner,” he said. With his Cabinet picks, Biden shows he recognizes the urgency of climate change It remains unclear whether Democrats will aggressively use another tool at their disposal — the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to nullify a rule within 60 legislative days of its adoption. Republicans used this to wipe out several environmental safeguards adopted at the end of the Obama administration. But the law then blocks Congress from adopting a regulation that is “substantially the same” in the future. Despite the legislative hurdles, there is little question the new administration will now have willing allies in positions of power on Capitol Hill. “I see climate change for the existential threat it poses to my state, our nation and the world,” Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.), who is poised to take over the Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement. “The climate crisis is a challenge too big and too great to be met with small thinking and short-term solutions.” Meanwhile, Carper said there has already been one change resulting from the runoff. “I woke up in bed this morning, the first words my wife said to me [were] ‘Good morning, Mr. Chairman.’ ” Dino Grandoni contributed to this report.",How the Georgia election results just raised Biden’s climate ambitions
233,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/06/trump-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge-polar-bears/,WP,Towards Left,"Trump administration officials auctioned off oil and gas leases in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on Wednesday, capping Republicans’ decades-long quest to drill in one of the nation’s most vast unspoiled wild places. The move marks one of the most significant environmental rollbacks the president has accomplished in his term. But with lackluster oil prices and an increasing number of banks saying they would not finance Arctic energy projects, major oil companies did not try to buy the leases. That left the state agency, Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, as the main bidder. The agency put up all but two of the winning bids, which went to a couple of small energy firms. The sale of 11 tracts on just over 550,000 acres netted $14.4 million, a tiny fraction of what Republicans initially predicted it would yield. Only two of the bids were competitive, so nearly all of the land sold for the minimum price of $25 an acre. Interior Deputy Secretary Kate MacGregor, who stood before a camera and read the bids out loud as she pulled them out of manila folders, announced at the start of the sale, “Today is truly historic.” Noting that many people had spent years working to open the refuge up to drilling, she said, “Thank you for your grit and for your determination.” While a 2017 law compels the government to auction another several hundred thousand acres by the end of 2024, the incoming administration may be able to overturn that requirement now that Democrats have won control of the Senate in the wake of Tuesday’s runoff elections in Georgia. A coalition of environmental and conservation groups tried to block the sale on the grounds that the administration had cut corners in crafting the leasing program, but U.S. District Judge Sharon Gleason denied their request for a preliminary injunction Tuesday evening. The Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management will offer drilling rights to most of the refuge’s nearly 1.6 million-acre coastal plain, which attracts hundreds of thousands of migrating caribou and waterfowl each year and provides critical habitat for the Southern Beaufort Sea’s remaining polar bears. As sea ice on the Arctic Ocean abutting the refuge shrinks, the bears — threatened with extinction due to climate change — have been forced to spend more time on land. Federal scientists estimate that a third of the bears’ maternal dens lie within the area the administration has opened up for energy development. The refuge has become a rallying point for Republicans and environmentalists alike, who have fought for 40 years over whether to tap into the fossil fuels lying beneath it. The government estimates there could be 7.7 billion barrels of recoverable oil on the coastal plain, though seismic surveys have not been conducted since the 1980s. The BLM is in the process of letting the Kaktovik Iñupiat Corporation conduct seismic tests there this winter. The sale marks the culmination of President Trump’s push to expand oil and gas drilling across the country, including in some of its most ecologically sensitive areas. On Monday, the BLM opened up an additional 7 million acres for leasing on the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, home to a critical calving area for tens of thousands of caribou and migratory feeding ground for hundreds of thousands of birds. Trump officials predict that extracting oil from the relatively pristine refuge, which supports 270 species, will require as many as four airstrips and major well pads, 175 miles of roads, vertical supports for pipelines, a seawater treatment plant and a barge landing and storage site. Drilling operations could last for nearly a half-century. A number of Alaska Native officials — including those in Kaktovik, which lies within the refuge’s boundaries and has surface land rights next to the coastal plain — back energy development on the refuge. The Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, which holds 92,000 acres of subsurface mineral rights, has also backed drilling there. In a federal court hearing Monday, where several environmental groups unsuccessfully sought a preliminary injunction to halt the lease sale, Tyson Kade — a lawyer for the North Slope Borough and Kaktovik — argued that such a move would cost Alaska Natives living in the region jobs and revenue. “The Court should consider the interests of the people who actually live on the North Slope and the coastal plain,” he said. But the Gwich’in people, who have relied for centuries on the Porcupine caribou herd that migrates each year through the refuge, have joined with conservationists in opposing any drilling there. Last month the BLM withdrew nearly 475,000 acres from the auction, citing public concerns about drilling’s impact on the caribou herd. Gleason ruled Tuesday the auction could go forward because the Gwich’in and other plaintiffs — including the National Audubon Society and Natural Resources Defense Council “have not established that they are likely to suffer imminent irreparable harm” since drilling is not expected to commence immediately. “In their push to sell off our lands to the fossil fuel industry, the Trump administration has engaged in a corrupt process and disrespected and dismissed the Indigenous people,” said Bernadette Demientieff, executive director of the Gwich’in Steering Committee. “We will continue to fight this illegal sale in court, and we call on President-elect Biden to act immediately to protect our lands from destructive drilling once and for all.” Opponents have also launched a public campaign to deter major financial institutions and energy firms from investing in such a project. America’s six largest banks and Canada’s five biggest banks have all pledged not to back energy exploration on the refuge. When asked recently whether Royal Dutch Shell planned to bid, the company’s chief executive Ben van Beurden said “Oh, no, no, no.” Shell bought leases in the Chukchi Sea off the northwest coast of Alaska in 2008 and spent more than $7 billion only to drill a dry hole in 2015. “We believe that the oil and gas upstream part is a foundational piece of business for us, but we’re going to be very selective on where we want to create value,” van Beurden said. “And I can tell you at the North Slope or offshore Alaska, it’s not going to be part of that.” Facing catastrophic climate change, this Alaska village is torn over whether to quit Big Oil One major bank said it had asked clients with assets in the region whether they planned to bid and they said absolutely not, according to the bank’s spokesman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect business relationships. Other potential bidders chose not to make offers. They included companies such as Hilcorp, which last year bought up all of BP’s properties in Alaska’s North Slope; Oil Search, an exploration company focused largely on Alaska; and Conoco Phillips, a sizable oil company that has made some discoveries on National Petroleum Reserve Alaska, west of the refuge. But BLM Alaska Director Chad Padgett called the auction “very successful,” adding that it was not surprising there wasn’t more interest. “It’s an area that’s unknown.” Anxiety about the possibility that no one would bid on the leases in the refuge prompted former governors Bill Walker and Frank Murkowski to write op-eds urging the state to place bids on the leases so that the state could sell or give the leases to oil companies to keep development moving. On Dec. 23, despite calls to spend the money elsewhere, the AIDEA board voted to spend up to $20 million, enough to buy 800,000 acres at the $25 rock bottom minimum price. While Congress projected in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 2017 that the lease program would raise $1.8 billion in revenue for the federal government, officials now say it will raise half that, and it could be even less. Justice Department lawyer Paul Turcke estimated Monday the sale would generate “many millions of dollars” split evenly between Alaska and the federal government. There has been little competition for leases on the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, where companies have operated for years. More than 90 percent of the leases sold since 2012 received just a single bid. In eight of the past nine years, there was not a single competitive bid on the reserve. President-elect Joe Biden has indicated he opposes any development on the refuge: On Tuesday, a senior transition official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he has yet to take office said of the auction: “It is just a sham, and a poke in the eye.” It remains unclear how much Biden can restrict drilling given the legal mandate to hold another auction by the end of 2024, though Democrats may be able to overturn this provision now that they have won both of Georgia’s Senate seats. Drew Caputo, Earthjustice’s vice president of litigation for lands, wildlife and oceans, noted that the Bureau of Land Management is supposed to hold quarterly auctions on its lands but can defer them repeatedly. “The 2017 tax law is way more prescriptive than BLM rules that cover oil and gas lease sales,” Caputo said, adding Biden will have “a binding obligation” to conduct a lease sale on the refuge by the end of his first term “unless the law is changed before then. That mandate is not an excuse for other legal violations, like inadequate environmental analysis.” There are four separate lawsuits challenging the administration’s environmental analysis of the proposed drilling program. Frank Macchiarola, senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs for the American Petroleum Institute, said in an email that the environmental review at issue “confirmed the potential to develop the area safely, and any company that chooses to invest will be held to the world’s highest environmental standards.” “Our members are laser-focused on continuing safe and environmentally sound energy production, and we will work with the Biden administration to support policies that balance U.S. energy leadership,” Macchiarola said.",Trump auctions drilling rights to Arctic National Wildlife Refuge 
234,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/05/new-trump-rule-says-its-okay-unintentionally-kill-scores-birds-biden-can-overturn-it/,WP,Towards Left,"In a last-gasp effort before departing the White House, the Trump administration took another swipe at weakening enforcement of a 100-year-old law that protects migrating birds. With only two weeks left in office, the administration published a rule Tuesday that spares industries and individuals from prosecution or penalties under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act if their actions, such as development or failure to cover tar pits, results in bird deaths. If the deaths were unintentional, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says in the rule, there will be no enforcement. Conservation groups immediately promised to sue to stop the rule from going into effect a month from now. They also called on the Biden administration to overturn it. The groups are confident a legal challenge will prevail due to an earlier court decision that rejected the opinion on which the new rule is based. U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni issued a blistering opinion in August that quoted Harper Lee’s famous novel, after deciding in favor of state attorneys general and conservationists who sued the administration. “It is not only a sin to kill a mockingbird, it is also a crime,” Caproni wrote. “That has been the letter of the law for the past century. But if the Department of the Interior has its way, many mockingbirds and other migratory birds that delight people and support ecosystems throughout the country will be killed without legal consequence.” On its face, the opinion that supported the administration’s rationale for changing the rule, Caproni decided, “is contrary to the plain meaning of the MBTA and therefore must be vacated.” But the Interior Department, which oversees the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, soldiered on with its rulemaking process despite the decision. In an analysis issued months after Caproni’s ruling, the department said it would not cause unacceptable environmental harm. “This rule simply reaffirms the original meaning and intent of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act by making it clear that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will not prosecute landowners, industry and other individuals for accidentally killing a migratory bird,"" said Interior Secretary David Bernhardt. The administration’s decision to relax enforcement against killing birds, mostly on behalf of the oil and gas industry, followed two major reports that said human activity has triggered the sixth great extinction of wildlife, including the loss of billions of birds in North America. In May 2019, a United Nations panel determined that 1 million species face extinction — “more than any other period in human history.” Four months later, top ornithologists in government and academia reported that 3 billion birds have vanished in North America over the past 50 years. “The historic environmental protections under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act have been upheld for nearly a century,"" Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said in a statement. “The Trump administration’s new rule renders these safeguards absolutely toothless, and means corporations would no longer be subject to penalties under this landmark environmental law for disasters like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.” The American Exploration and Production Council, an oil industry lobby group, supported the rule, saying oil and gas facilities “are much less of a threat to birds.” Companies screen facilities and remove harmful substances from pits, and use nets and fences to cover the pits and prevent birds from plunging in. “American oil and gas companies use technological innovations and follow all applicable regulations to protect migratory birds,"" Anne Bradbury, the council’s chief executive, said in a statement. ""We fully support the final ‘Migratory Bird’ rule; better defining the scope of the MBTA and its prohibitions provides much-needed clarification of the Congressional intent and acknowledges current industry best practices to protect migratory birds and their habitat.” Past Fish and Wildlife estimates show that industry sources kill an average of 709 million birds each year, and up to 1.1 billion. Oil pits alone kill up to 1 million birds yearly. That compares to 1.4 billion birds killed by feral and household cats, and nearly a billion killed in automobile collisions. Nearly 600 million birds fly into glass buildings each year, and power lines electrocute 5.6 million. The Center for Biological Diversity is one of the groups that promised to sue. ""We’re certainly going to challenge this and are confident we will overturn this,” said Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the center. The center is part of a coalition of groups that prevailed in the earlier lawsuit, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Audubon Society and Defenders of Wildlife. “The court found that their interpretation is inconsistent with the law, and they just plowed forward anyway,"" Greenwald said. “It was a paper exercise to try and hold on to something they were already doing. If the courts don’t overturn it, the Biden administration probably will."" Biden selected Rep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.) to replace Bernhardt at Interior. Haaland, an environmental justice advocate, has frequently criticized President Trump’s environmental policies. “Americans want birds and nature taken care of — not swept aside to serve commercial interests. We urge the incoming Administration to right this wrong as rapidly as possible,” said Steve Holmer of American Bird Conservancy. Jim Murphy, director of legal advocacy at the National Wildlife Federation, pointed out that iconic species such as the snowy egret, wood duck and sandhill crane are disappearing at a time when the administration is easing rules to protect them. “This decision completely fails to comply with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and will likely result in countless avoidable bird deaths,"" Murphy said in a statement. “We are calling on the Biden administration and Congress to right this historic wrong by reinstating the act’s protections and taking up the Migratory Bird Protection Act in the 117th Congress.”",A new Trump rule says it’s okay to unintentionally kill scores of birds. Biden can overturn it.
235,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/04/epa-scientific-transparency/?itid=sf_climate-environment,WP,Towards Left,"The Environmental Protection Agency has finalized a rule to limit what research it can use to craft public health protections, a move opponents argue is aimed at crippling the agency’s ability to more aggressively regulate the nation’s air and water. The “Strengthening Transparency in Pivotal Science Underlying Significant Regulatory Actions and Influential Scientific Information” rule, which the administration began pursuing early in President Trump’s term, would require researchers to disclose the raw data involved in their public health studies before the agency could rely upon their conclusions. It will apply this new set of standards to “dose-response studies,” which evaluate how much a person’s exposure to a substance increases the risk of harm. While EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler signed the final rule last week, he announced it Tuesday at a virtual session hosted by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a think tank that advocates fewer federal regulations and disputes the idea that climate change poses a major threat to the United States. “The American public deserves to know which studies we are using to craft our regulations,” Wheeler said. “We want to make all this information available to the public and shine some light on it.” Many of the nation’s leading researchers and academic organizations, however, argue that the criteria will actually restrict the EPA from using some of the most consequential research on human subjects because it often includes confidential medical records and other proprietary data that cannot be released because of privacy concerns. “The people pushing it are claiming it’s in the interest of science, but the entire independent science world says it’s not,” said Chris Zarba, a former director of the EPA’s Science Advisory Board who retired in 2018 after nearly four decades at the agency. “It sounds good on the surface. But this is a bold attempt to get science out of the way so special interests can do what they want.” The new standards affect not just “significant regulatory actions,” according to the new rule, but also “influential scientific information” that the EPA shares with the public, on its websites and elsewhere. The rule reflects the Trump administration’s dogged push to lock in as many policies as possible before President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20. Although the new administration will probably seek to overturn it, such an effort will take months, if not longer. The EPA administrator is allowed to waive the requirement on a case-by-case basis, but it is possible that outside groups could challenge those waivers in court. Forcing researchers to disclose their raw data has for years been a top priority for conservative Republicans — including some now working in the EPA’s upper ranks. The new rule was modeled on a bill championed by former House Science Committee chairman Lamar Smith (R-Tex.). One of the panel’s former staffers, Richard Yamada, helped write an early version of the regulation while serving at the EPA. Conservatives have been particularly critical of two studies that have spurred increased regulation: a 1993 Harvard University “Six Cities” project that linked air pollution to premature deaths and a Columbia University analysis of a widely used pesticide, chlorpyrifos, that suggested the chemical causes neurological damage in babies. According to a document obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Trump officials discussed how to block such research in a Jan. 25, 2018, briefing on the proposed rule. Referring to Harvard’s Six Cities study and another pollution study conducted by the American Cancer Society, the notes read, “The scientific community has identified major shortcomings in the methodologies and findings of these studies, all of which could be addressed if EPA provided the underlying data for independent review.” In the wake of protests from public health experts and congressional Democrats, the EPA revised the proposal so that it would not apply retroactively to past assessments of studies like the ones cited in the 2018 meeting. But Environmental Defense Fund General Counsel Vickie Patton, whose group obtained the document, said in an email that it “reveals the Trump EPA is focused on attacking the peer-reviewed health science that has saved tens of thousands of lives each year from deadly air pollution and protected America’s children from pesticides.” EPA rejects tougher standards for soot, which disproportionately hurts Americans of color Andrew Rosenberg, who directs the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Center for Science and Democracy and regularly reviews scientific studies before they are published in academic journals, said that the agency’s emphasis on the need for raw data is misplaced. “As a well-experienced peer reviewer, I very rarely scrutinize raw data,” he said. “Rather, I look at data collection and analysis methods, summary and other statistics and graphics and results and conclusions to determine the validity of a study and the strength of its scientific evidence.” The EPA has not published estimates on how much it will cost to implement the rule and what effect it will have on public health. Because researchers are particularly reluctant to release individual medical records used in human studies, Rosenberg said, the rule disproportionately affects “epidemiological studies, which is ironic in the midst of a pandemic. Because these data can’t be made public, EPA will ignore epidemiological evidence of population-level effects of contaminants, pollution and other environmental threats.” Wheeler said critics of the rule had distorted both its intent and its impact. He said that a “pivotal study” like the Harvard one, which has influenced key federal pollution standards that have saved thousands of lives and been economically beneficial, might still be able to inform future policies if the next administrator determines it is justified and publishes the reasoning behind that decision. “There is no study that will automatically be cut out from review by the agency,” he said. “What this new rule would undoubtedly do is provide transparency needed to allow the public the opportunity needed to check our work.” The American Chemistry Council, the primary trade association for U.S. chemical companies, was among the supporters who welcomed the new rule.  “It will strengthen EPA’s regulatory process by helping ensure that it is relying on the best available science — science that is reliable and unbiased — and by making the underlying research and data publicly available in ways that protect personal privacy, confidential business information, proprietary interests and intellectual property rights,” ACC spokesman Jon Corley said in a statement. Thomas Sinks, who previously led the Office of the Science Advisor at the EPA and oversaw its rules on research involving human subjects, is among numerous scientists who note that the EPA already has a robust scientific integrity policy and a long-standing peer-review process for any data upon which it relies. “It is based on a conspiracy theory, which is that EPA practices secret science,” Sinks, who wrote a forceful rebuke of the new rule before his retirement in September, said of the effort. “But there’s no evidence EPA practices secret science. I’m unaware of an example where EPA hasn’t clearly stated what science it is using in its rulemaking.” Sinks said he also worries that Tuesday’s final rule deepens the broader attack on science by the Trump administration, and that it could have a lasting impact that goes beyond any single regulation. “I’m mostly concerned about the fact this rule and other actions like this rule are diminishing the efforts and the importance of science and scientists within the federal government,” he said. “That is a dangerous precedent.”",EPA finalizes rule to limit science behind public health safeguards

The killing begins Monday.https://t.co/RI95yk35nw Wolves lost protections in the waning days of the Trump administration against the objections of wildlife associations and environmental organizations. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service delisted gray wolves as endangered on Jan. 4, eliminating protections under the federal Endangered Species Act.  Earlier this month, the Wisconsin Institute of Law and Liberty filed suit against the state’s Department of Natural Resources (DNR) on behalf of Hunter Nation, a Kansas-based hunting group, demanding to hold the weeklong hunt starting Monday. Republican state lawmakers also wanted to hurry the hunt because they feared President Joe Biden would reinstitute protections, The Associated Press reported. The DNR had planned a wolf-hunting season in the state, just not until November, long after spring birthing. Such a delay would give pups time to grow and allow for a thorough assessment of the wolf population, public input and planning. However, a Jefferson County Circuit Court judge ruled this month that the DNR had overlooked its duty to hold a wolf hunting season this winter. The Court of Appeals on Friday then dismissed the DNR’s bid to overturn that decision, ruling that “this court lacks jurisdiction over a direct appeal at this time.” This is what family looks like 🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾 https://t.co/VTL5Xb0oJV More than 20,000 hunters have applied for permits, DNR officials told The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, and some 4,000 permits costing $49 each will be granted.  Although the hunt is scheduled through Feb. 28, it will continue until 200 wolves are slain. Adjustments may be made to that number, pending requests from Native American tribes in the state, which have hunting or wolf protection claims. The DNR estimated there were more than 1,000 wolves in 256 packs in the state. Experts warn that the wolf population has not yet recovered and a hunt like this could put the animals back on the road to extinction.

238,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-wall-what-happens-now-biden_n_6031ac63c5b66dfc101f1a35,HP,Far Left,"Former President Donald Trump built only a fraction of the “big, beautiful” U.S.-Mexico border wall he repeatedly promised voters — but its effects, experts say, have nevertheless been “catastrophic” and far-reaching. With Trump now out of the White House, conservationists, tribal leaders and others are hopeful President Joe Biden will take immediate action to not just halt construction but dismantle the parts of Trump’s wall that have encroached on vulnerable ecosystems and sacred lands. It remains to be seen, however, what the new president plans to do with the controversial structure. Biden vowed in August not to build “another foot of wall” during his presidency and, on his first day in office, signed a proclamation pausing all wall construction for 60 days. But reports this month of ongoing construction along some stretches of the barrier, including in a part of Arizona designated as critical habitat for endangered jaguars, have left environmentalists and community members anxious and uncertain as to whether the president intends to keep his promise. Biden has also stayed silent as to whether he intends to take down any existing wall or what his plans are — if any — to mitigate the damage that Trump’s wall has already wreaked. Trump promised his supporters his administration would build at least 450 miles of new barriers at the southern border by the end of 2020 but fell well short of his goal. According to a December report by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 438 miles of “border wall system” was constructed under Trump, but of that, only about 40 miles was new primary fencing. Trump mostly replaced parts of existing wall that were outdated or in disrepair.   There’s little evidence to suggest Trump’s construction efforts — which cost billions of dollars, most of which were not authorized by Congress — had any significant impact on curtailing drug trafficking or reducing the number of undocumented migrants crossing the border, despite Trump’s insistence to the contrary.  But the wall’s construction did have drastic and detrimental consequences. Vanda Felbab-Brown, a Brookings Institution security expert, rattled off some of those earlier this month: “Trump’s wall has been enormously environmentally destructive, depleting water sources and destroying aquifers, as well as damaging mountain landscapes and sensitive ecosystems that could take centuries to recover.” Trump’s wall also desecrated land considered sacred to Native Americans, including destroying at least one ancient burial site using dynamite, and created a physical barrier dividing the communities of the Tohono O’odham Nation whose land straddles the border. The wall cost ― and continues to cost ― taxpayers billions of dollars, Felbab-Brown added. “First there’s all the money that has already been sunk into it … but also the money that will go into maintenance and repair,” she said. “These are vast sums that need to be spent every few years.” Terence Garrett, a professor of political science at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, agreed the effects of Trump’s wall have been “catastrophic.” “Here’s what Trump was doing — build the fence, then ask questions,” said Garrett, whose university sits right at the U.S.-Mexico border. Garrett has written extensively about the impacts of Trump’s wall, including on private landowners and the COVID-19 pandemic. Garrett said in an August paper that Trump’s wall, coupled with his administration’s zero-tolerance immigration policies, had sparked a humanitarian crisis by stymying international cooperation and sending migrants who’d contracted the coronavirus on U.S. soil back to their home countries.  Garrett and other experts say that while Trump’s wall could have some irreparable consequences, at least some effects could be alleviated if Biden acts promptly and decisively. A coalition composed of dozens of cities and hundreds of organizations, including tribal and environmental groups, is preparing a petition for the Biden administration that demands the removal of wall segments that have, among other things, disturbed sacred lands, destroyed sensitive wilderness areas and interfered with natural water flows. The document, which has yet to be made public but was reviewed by HuffPost, is urging the administration to remove segments of wall in all four border states: California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. The petition is also calling for all outstanding border wall contracts agreed on under the Trump administration to be canceled and for no further construction to be carried out.  Laiken Jordahl, borderlands campaigner for the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the petition’s signatories, said the coalition also wants the Biden administration to redirect the funds earmarked for the wall project to borderland communities affected by the barrier.  “We want them to use the remaining funds to revegetate areas devastated by the wall and compensate impacted tribal nations,” Jordahl said. “We desperately need to involve voices from border communities in these conversations. The Trump administration completely steamrolled our communities.”  Jordahl said hopes had initially been high that wall construction would end for good once Biden took office.  “We are breathing a sigh of relief,” he said on Feb. 8. “For the first time in years, there’s no active construction at the border.” But less than a week later, Jordahl raised the alarm after construction appeared to have restarted in Arizona’s Pajarito Mountains, a critical part of a migration corridor for the North American jaguar, a protected species under the federal Endangered Species Act. (In 2017, Trump authorized contractors to bypass the act, among several other environmental laws, in order to get the structure built.)  Conservationists have long warned of the potentially disastrous effects that Trump’s wall could have on the jaguar, as well as dozens of other threatened and endangered species.    “These corridors have been identified by the federal government as critical for the jaguar,” Jordahl said. “If Biden doesn’t stop these walls from being built, jaguars will not recover. Their fate is in the hands of the Biden administration.” He later added that the recent construction work appeared to be “a direct violation” of Biden’s presidential order.  ALERT: Contractors are still hard at work building Trump's #BorderWall. They're leveling mountains & destroying jaguar habitat in an apparent violation of Biden's order to halt construction. @POTUS must investigate & stop this madness for good. Footage shot by Tucson Samaritans. pic.twitter.com/cjn7Cj4lz8 When asked about the construction work, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers told HuffPost that while “all border infrastructure projects” had been suspended “until further notice,” contractors are “still required by the terms of their contracts to maintain safe and secure job sites.” This could include securing equipment, covering or filling open trenches and providing erosion control, the spokeswoman said. She did not specifically address the work being done in the Pajarito Mountains, but said “most of these minimum safety and security-related activities, which are designed to protect life, health and safety, will be visible to the public.” “These activities are necessary to comply with the President’s proclamation to pause all border barrier construction,” she added.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to HuffPost’s specific questions about the recent construction, but said in a statement that it “remains fully committed to implementing President Biden’s immigration and border security-related executive actions, including the pause of construction on the Border Wall System and adjusting its operations to enforce the proclamations related to travel and entry to the United States.”  A spokesman for the White House declined to comment as to Biden’s plans regarding the wall, including whether he intends to take down any part of it.  Whatever Biden chooses to do, it’s assured the president will face an uphill climb. Felbab-Brown said Republican lawmakers will undoubtedly push back against any proposed removal of the wall, and expensive legal battles could be waged if outstanding construction contracts are canceled. A recent Army Corps estimate said terminating these contracts could also lead to “demobilization” fees amounting to some $700 million. “It’s important to get rid of the wall,” especially the parts of it that are on vulnerable wilderness areas and tribal lands, Felbab-Brown said. “But it might not be easy for the Biden administration to do so.”   Jordahl said he’s nonetheless hopeful that Biden will act to mitigate the impacts of the wall on borderland communities and habitats. After all, he noted, border communities in Arizona helped Biden win the election. “Border communities have been ignored for so long ― but it seems that, finally, people across the country can see the severe amount of injustice inflicted here,” Jordahl said. “Border communities helped delivered Biden’s win here in Arizona. I think he owes it to us.” ",Biden Has Inherited Trump’s Catastrophic Border Wall. What Happens Next?

Greg Abbott (R) to blame wind and solar energy failures as the main culprits for the power crisis in Texas, calling that claim “actually wrong.” “The main capacity that’s gone out in Texas is not the wind; it’s actually some of the natural gas plants that were also not ready for the super-cold temperatures.” Gates said Wednesday in a Yahoo Finance interview. Abbott made his assertion in an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Tuesday, saying that wind turbines that were frozen in Texas by a severe winter storm showed how a Green New Deal ― the series of environmental initiatives promoted by progressives to combat climate change ― “would be a deadly deal for the United States of America.” “Texas is blessed with multiple sources of energy such as natural gas and oil and nuclear, as well as solar and wind,” Abbott said. “But ... our wind and our solar got shut down [by the storm] and they were collectively more than 10% of our power grid. And that thrust Texas into a situation where it was lacking power on a statewide basis ... As a result, it just shows that fossil fuel is necessary for the state of Texas, as well as other states.” Gates, who recently authored the book “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster” said those were misleading comments. “He’s actually wrong,” the Microsoft co-founder said, noting the significantly larger role played by crippled natural gas production.  Information released by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) confirmed that the blackouts were primarily caused by the freezing of natural gas pipelines that were not properly weatherized to withstand the cold. Wind energy, on the other hand, surpassed daily production forecasts last weekend as the winter storm swept across Texas. Abbott himself walked back his Fox News comments at a Wednesday press conference, admitting that “every source of power” for Texas “has been compromised, whether it be renewable power such as wind or solar, but also ... access to coal-generated power, access to gas-generated power.” In his interview, Gates added that relying entirely on wind and solar power remains problematic and that a state like Texas needed three things in its power grid, especially as climate change ushers in more extreme weather in the future. “One is more transmission,” Gates said. “if Texas had had slightly more of a connection [for renewables], they wouldn’t have had a problem. The second is energy storage; it’s still hard to store these amounts of energy. And finally, sources of energy that aren’t weather-dependent but are green, like nuclear.” ERCOT announced on Thursday morning that rolling blackouts had stopped in Texas. But hundreds of thousands of Texans remained without power. ",Bill Gates: Texas Governor 'Wrong' To Blame Wind And Solar Energy For Blackouts

Gates made the comments on “60 Minutes” two days before the release of his book on climate change, called “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.” When asked about the mammoth task ahead — made even more apparent after 2020 tied with 2016 to become the hottest year on record — the billionaire said it would take dramatic innovation over the next 30 years on a scale unlike any in human history. Anderson Cooper: “You believe this is the toughest challenge humanity has ever faced?” Gates: “Absolutely. The amount of change, new ideas. It’s way greater than the pandemic. And it needs a level of cooperation that would be unprecedented. …” Cooper: “It sounds impossible.” Gates: “We have more educated people than ever. We have a generation that’s speaking out on this topic. And, you know, I got to participate in the miracle of the personal computer and the internet. And so, yes, I have a bias to believe innovation can do these things.”  “It’ll be the most amazing thing mankind has ever done,” says Bill Gates about getting to zero carbon emissions. “It’s an all-out effort, you know, like a world war, but it’s us against greenhouse gases.” https://t.co/pBAn6L6Wdp pic.twitter.com/Ke8yIG6o6G Gates said he supported President Joe Biden’s day one decision to rejoin the Paris Agreement, but said the White House should dramatically increase the federal budget for climate change and clean energy research to $35 billion a year. The U.S. currently spends around $7 billion annually on such topics, but Gates has argued climate change should be placed on equal footing with public health funding. Cooper: “You’ve been criticized for being a technocrat, saying technology is the only solution for― for tackling climate change. There are other people that say, ‘Look, the solutions are already there. It’s just government policy is what really needs to be focused on.’” Gates: “I wish that was true. I wish all this funding of these companies wasn’t necessary at all. Without innovation, we will not solve climate change. We won’t even come close.” Bill Gates says the U.S. has to lead the world getting to zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and is asking the Biden administration to massively increase the budget for climate change energy research to $35 billion a year. https://t.co/wh2DwPpFGm pic.twitter.com/kCO6uiy3DF In Sunday’s interview, Gates said innovation should focus beyond the issues society already knows about — electric cars, clean energy — and loop in things like concrete and steel manufacturing, which account for 16% of all carbon emissions.

Cooper asked Gates about his own carbon footprint during the interview, which the billionaire said was likely “one of the highest” in the world.

U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill granted a summary judgment to the Western Watersheds Project and other environmental organizations, which had sued to protect the land. Winmill called the Bureau of Land Management’s decision to suddenly reverse protections for the bird’s habitat throughout the American West “arbitrary and capricious.” “The court finds that the reasons given do not provide the reasoned explanation needed to support the BLM’s change in position regarding the need for the withdrawal, rendering the cancellation decision arbitrary and capricious,” Winmill wrote.  “We’re grateful our legal system once again protected the vanishing greater sage grouse from the reckless, lawbreaking Trump administration,” said Michael Saul, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, which was also part of the suit. “The Trump administration’s illegal gift to the mining industry lifted protections for 10 million acres of crucial sage-grouse habitat and would’ve pushed this beautiful bird closer to extinction. Now the new Interior secretary can establish appropriate habitat protections based on science, not favoritism to the mining industry.” Erik Molvar, executive director of the Western Watersheds Project, called the ruling a “decisive win” for sage grouse and other species of wildlife that depend on the habitats.  Most of the affected areas are in Idaho and Nevada. The BLM and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had decided in previous years to bar mining in the areas to protect the sage grouse. Sage grouse, ground-dwelling game birds with an elaborate mating ritual, used to number in the millions in the nation. Loss of sagebrush habitat from development and invasive plant species has decimated the population, now estimated between 200,000 to 500,000. Their current range spans about 257,000 square miles across 11 Western states, less than half of the species’ historic range. The Department of the Interior still has an opportunity to present a rational argument for why the change should be made.

Derek Allen told the South Bend Tribune. Melissa Kuczmanski, who was driving with her son on U.S. 35 near the town of Kingsbury when the herd of 10-month-old Holsteins dashed past them on Saturday afternoon, caught the spectacle on video.  “It was kind of a joyous moment; I was looking for the universe to send me some really cool wildlife sightings, and boom,” she told the Tribune. She noted that the cows were peaceful and no motorists were in danger “as long as you pulled over and let them pass.” galong  The sight was especially unusual because the animals stayed together and ran as a group for several miles, Rick Welsh, the owner of the farm, told The Farmer’s Exchange. Cows usually scatter and go in different directions in these kinds of situations, he said. “These guys were on a mission,” Welsh said. That mission, however, may never be accomplished. Allen, along with other law enforcement, firefighters and passersby, corralled the rebellious young cows and returned them to Welsh’s farm, where he raises them to be sold as dairy cattle. Welsh suspected the animals may have gotten out after a prankster opened a gate, but he didn’t know for sure. Whatever prompted their mass exit, the Holsteins follow in the hoofsteps of other cows who made headlines after trying to make their own way in the world. In 2018, a cow being led to a slaughterhouse-bound truck in Poland fled, busted through a metal fence and broke a farm worker’s arm before swimming to an island where she evaded capture for weeks. When she was finally recaptured, she died from stress. The following year, a cow named Betsy escaped from a rodeo and retreated into the Alaskan forest. Since then, outdoor enthusiasts periodically reported seeing a mysterious cow in the woods, and Betsy earned the nickname “ghost in the darkness.”",Dozens Of Cows Temporarily Take Over Highway After Hightailing It Off Farm
244,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fossil-fuel-air-pollution_n_6022a51dc5b6c56a89a49185,HP,Far Left,"Air pollution from burning fossil fuels caused 1 in 5 deaths worldwide in 2018, killing more than 8 million people, according to Harvard University research published Tuesday.  The finding, based on new models that use atmospheric chemistry, significantly increased the previous estimates for deaths linked to tiny particles of burned carbon that lodge in soft lung tissue and cause respiratory diseases, trigger asthma attacks, and cloud cities with smog. The most recent prior estimate from the world’s largest and most comprehensive study of global deaths, known as the Global Burden of Disease Study, pegged the total lives lost to outdoor airborne particulate matter ― which includes not only fossil fuel pollution, but also dust, wildfire smoke and burning crop fields ― at 4.2 million per year. But the new research, published in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Research, shows nearly double that total from fossil fuel pollution alone, with the highest concentrations of fossil fuel-related deaths in regions with some of the most populous cities, where combustion-engine automobiles, fuel-heated buildings and sprawling power plants abound. Those regions include eastern North America, Europe and Southeast Asia. “Our study adds to the mounting evidence that air pollution from ongoing dependence on fossil fuels is detrimental to global health,” Eloise Marais, an associate professor at University College London and a co-author of the research, said in a statement. “We can’t in good conscience continue to rely on fossil fuels, when we know that there are such severe effects on health and viable, cleaner alternatives.” It comes at a moment when the effects of air pollution are facing new scientific and legal scrutiny. In December, a landmark ruling in the United Kingdom found air pollution was to blame for a 9-year-old girl’s fatal asthma attack. The research is also likely to draw blowback from an increasingly organized effort on the political right, particularly in the U.S., to downplay the effects of air pollution. The Trump administration, which had been advised by industry allies who previously worked to undermine climate science and seed doubt over the effects of smoking cigarettes on lung cancer, worked to weaken federal research and regulatory authority on air pollution. The study, conducted with British researchers at the University of Birmingham, the University of Leicester and University College London, will likely amplify calls to rapidly transition off fossil fuels, demonstrating an additional reason ― beyond the need to preserve a habitable global climate ― for promoting policies that prioritize renewable electricity and electric vehicles. “The health gains we can achieve from getting off fossil fuels is twice what we thought it was yesterday,” Aaron Bernstein, director of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health’s Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment, said in a press release. Earlier estimates of dangerous airborne particulate matter, known as PM2.5, relied on satellite and surface observations to generate a global average. But the new research employed a 3-D model of atmospheric chemistry called GEOS-Chem, which allowed the scientists to carve up the entire world into boxes as small as 50 kilometers by 60 kilometers ― or roughly 31 miles by 37 miles ― and examine pollution levels in each area. From there, the researchers estimated emissions from sectors including electricity, heavy industry, shipping, aircraft and ground transportation. They then simulated how those aerosols reacted with weather conditions using data from the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office and compared 2018 to 2012 figures to weed out the ways cyclical El Niño warming patterns amplified pollution in 2018. After pinpointing the concentrations of fossil fuel-generated PM2.5 in each box on the global grid, the scientists compared the findings to existing epidemiological studies and developed new risk-assessment models explicitly linking concentrations of fossil fuel air pollutants to local health outcomes. The new model showed much higher death rates from long-term exposure to fossil fuel pollution, even at lower levels. “Often, when we discuss the dangers of fossil fuel combustion, it’s in the context of CO2 and climate change and overlook the potential health impact of the pollutants co-emitted with greenhouse gases,” Joel Schwartz, the Harvard professor of environmental epidemiology who developed the new models, said in a statement. “We hope that by quantifying the health consequences of fossil fuel combustion, we can send a clear message to policymakers and stakeholders of the benefits of a transition to alternative energy sources.”","Fossil Fuel Air Pollution Linked To 1 In 5 Deaths Worldwide, New Harvard Study Finds"

The Chicago Tribune reported in 2018 that Donald Trump’s building was the only major downtown user of the water that was ignoring state and federal laws aimed at protecting fish in the reviving river.  Total fines for the violations could be as much as $12 million, local WGN9-TV reported. State Attorney General Kwame Raoul is demanding the maximum penalty. Cook County Circuit Court Judge Sophia Hall decided late last month in a ruling made public Friday that the Trump building violated both the Illinois Environmental Protection Act and the Illinois Pollution Control Board Regulations, and that penalties will be determined after a hearing in March.

It sucks up nearly 20 million gallons of river water a day before returning the water 35 degrees hotter, according to the suit, which was joined by the Sierra Club and Friends of the Chicago River. Fish are often killed as they’re sucked against filter screens, and also suffer the effects of the warmed water.

In one of his first acts as president, Biden issued an executive order on Wednesday to bring the United States, the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, back into the global treaty committing nearly 200 countries to halt rising temperatures quickly enough to avoid disastrous climate change. Washington formally left the Paris accord last year but its role as a heavyweight in global climate negotiations had already stalled with the 2016 election of President Donald Trump. Trump cast doubt on climate science and asserted that the accord was an economic burden. U.N. climate negotiations have stuttered since then, with multiple summits failing to deliver ambitious action. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they get a standing ovation just by entering the room,” former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres said, referring to a U.S. return to global climate talks. “That doesn’t mean that they will have a standing ovation forever. They have to prove that they are really determined to make the changes that are necessary.” U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres welcomed the U.S. return to the Paris accord but added: “There is a very long way to go. The climate crisis continues to worsen and time is running out to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius and build more climate-resilient societies that help to protect the most vulnerable.” Climate diplomats said they want to see an ambitious U.S. commitment to cut emissions this decade and a diplomatic push to convince others to follow suit. Top of the list would be China, the world’s biggest polluter, which plans to become carbon neutral by 2060 but has yet to unveil a short-term plan to reduce emissions. Climate agreements signed by China and the United States played a big role in securing a deal at the Paris climate talks in 2015. But during the Trump administration, climate became another source of friction between the world’s two biggest economies, and experts said it was unlikely that their relationship could immediately return to normal. “A lot has changed since the Obama years that will make the G2 climate relationship under Biden unpredictable,” said Li Shuo, senior climate and energy policy officer for Greenpeace East Asia, referring to the United States and China as the G2. Li pointed to the rock-bottom U.S.-China relationship and divisive politics that create challenges for climate engagement. “What remains unchanged is the need for the G2 to move towards the same direction ... Now the task is for the pair to switch to high gear, holding each other’s hand or not,” Li said. Biden has said he wants to put the United States on track to net zero emissions by 2050 but has yet to detail what regulatory tools he intends to use to achieve that goal. “One of the core challenges for the administration is going to be reframing this as opportunity for green growth, for jobs - for the kind of things we’ve seen in Europe, which has managed to significantly grow its economy while reducing its carbon emissions,” said Kelley Kizzier, a former European Union climate negotiator, now at the non-profit Environmental Defense Fund. The EU is already eyeing areas for collaboration. In June, it will propose a carbon levy on imports of certain polluting goods to protect European industry from cheaper competitors in countries with weak climate policies. Biden pledged in his election campaign to do the same, through “carbon adjustment fees or quotas” at the U.S. border. Carbon border policies offer “an opportunity to work together to set a global template for such measures,” the EU said in a December memo on its priorities for the new EU relationship with the Biden administration. Policy analysts say a joint U.S.-EU carbon border measure could drive faster decarbonisation in countries with high-emitting export-oriented sectors - including China, the world’s largest steel producer. “This is a very important tool in the hands of the EU and the U.S. administration to stimulate global climate action,” said Simone Tagliapietra, research fellow at Brussels-based think tank Bruegel. Frans Timmermans, the EU climate policy chief, said he would team up with John Kerry, Biden’s international climate envoy, “to convince ever more countries that ambitious climate action is in their best interest.” But for vulnerable countries grappling with floods, heat waves and droughts made more devastating by climate change, the priority is finance. Former President Barack Obama’s administration pledged to deliver $3 billion to the U.N. flagship fund to help vulnerable countries fight climate change. Washington has delivered only $1 billion so far. “President Biden should fulfil the remaining pledge,” said Tanguy Gahouma-Bekale, chair of the African Group of Negotiators in global climate talks.

248,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/biden-paris-climate_n_60084fb9c5b697df1a0ad74e,HP,Far Left,"Newly inaugurated President Joe Biden ordered his government to begin the process of reentering the climate pact former President Donald Trump exited.  It’s part of a suite of executive orders on climate change, including ones that will block the Keystone XL pipeline and start assessing Trump’s deregulatory legacy.  Hours after his inauguration Wednesday, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to rejoin the Paris Agreement, ending the United States’ brief but symbolic exit from the global pact to slash planet-heating emissions that virtually every nation has joined. Biden’s executive order kick-starts a relatively simple process. After sending a letter to the United Nations announcing its intentions to reenter the climate accord, the U.S. will again become a formal party to the global negotiations in 30 days.  It was the third executive order he signed in the Oval Office. In separate executive orders, Biden is expected to lay the groundwork for the part that comes next and is much more of a challenge: reversing the Trump administration’s deregulatory legacy and setting ambitious new goals for decarbonizing the U.S. economy.  The executive actions include orders to pull permits for the Keystone XL oil pipeline, reestablish the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases, and direct all agencies to immediately review all rules and regulatory guidances enacted under former President Donald Trump.  The new administration has vowed to ramp up domestic climate action, nominating Gina McCarthy, a respected former Environmental Protection Agency administrator and environmentalist, to oversee a transformational domestic agenda aimed at making electric vehicles mainstream and eliminating emissions from the power sector by 2035. He pledged to put the country on course to reach net zero emissions by 2050.  The details of that effort will likely form the backbone of the U.S. Nationally Determined Contribution to the Paris Agreement’s emissions cuts, and give special climate envoy John Kerry, who helped broker the pact as the Obama-era secretary of state, concrete actions to point to as he embarks on his new climate-focused diplomatic mission. “The ambition that the U.S. is putting forward goes beyond what other countries have added to the mix,” said Ateli Iyalla, the managing director of CDP North America, a nonprofit that tracks carbon disclosures. “We need to be able to show we have the ambition.” Simply cutting pollution, however, won’t be enough to restore faith in a politically divided imperial superpower that seesaws between one party that accepts climate science and another that has for nearly two decades now rejected it whole-cloth. Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. pledged just $3 billion to the U.N.’s Green Climate Fund, a pot of money meant to help poor countries adapt to climate change and leapfrog over the fossil fuel phase of economic development. He had delivered just $1.5 billion by the time Trump took office and canceled all future payments.  Increasing payments to that fund could be one way to win back credibility ahead of the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow this year, where nations will convene to reassess emissions cuts and look back on the five years since the Paris Agreement was signed.  Another could be prioritizing fair trade agreements with the countries whose raw materials currently fuel the green industrial supply chain. Biden looks likely to boost domestic mining of the materials needed to make solar panels and batteries for electric cars and homes. But the existing supply chains already cause significant environmental destruction overseas.  Lithium mined in Chile uses massive amounts of water in the South American country’s desert regions, while Australia’s toxic hard-rock resource is exported to China for processing, causing pollution. Cobalt mined in the Democratic Republican of the Congo is linked to human rights abuses and mistreatment of informal miners. Indonesia’s nickel mines ― some of the world’s largest ― are a major source of ocean pollution.  The Biden administration could implement new rules to track raw materials and prioritize mass transit over policies to promote electric vehicles, limiting what’s expected to be a meteoric rise in demand. “The supply chains look like all supply chains under global capitalism: When you go to the extractive frontier, you see the hyper exploitation of labor, contamination of ecosystems and violations of Indigenous rights,” said Thea Riofrancos, a political scientist at Providence College and author of a new book on extractive industries in South America.  “What I would like to see is for the Biden administration to let go of this idea that individual passenger electric vehicles solve climate, embrace a public electrification vision, and be realistic about how the global supply chains are organized right now, so they can lay out a vision of green and just trade,” she added.  The administration’s trade agenda will hinge significantly on its relationship with China. It faces major obstacles. Ties between the world’s two largest economies reached their lowest point in decades under the Trump administration, which waged a haphazard trade war against China and, in its final days in office, declared Beijing’s brutal repression of its Muslim Uighur minority a genocide. Biden will confront those challenges while both he and Chinese officials face pressure from nationalists at home to intensify what looks increasingly like a cold war between the two countries.  Yet brokering a cooperative peace between the U.S. and China will be key to any global decarbonization plan. Abandoning plans to contain China’s growth and instead working together could help quickly deploy clean energy and climate solutions worldwide, said Jake Werner, a China researcher at Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center. China’s manufacturing capacity for clean energy products is “unmatched” and could be expanded, he said, while the U.S. controls the financial system and boasts an unrivaled network of formal alliances.  “If we want to transition the global economy away from fossil fuels as fast as we need it to, we need China to be doing a lot of the heavy lifting because of how strong its new-energy production capacity is,” Werner said. “The U.S. would be able to move a global Green New Deal diplomatically and would be able to line up financing for it in ways that would be complementary to what China brings to that project.”  Another novel approach the Biden administration could take to demonstrate its understanding of the U.S.’s disproportionate share of cumulative emissions would be to commit to funding and deploying technologies and policies to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Carbon removal broadly defines a set of approaches that range from nature-based ideas like planting new forests and adopting new soil farming techniques to technological solutions such as direct air capture, machines that suck CO2 from the atmosphere and transform it into a material that can be used in building materials or stored underground.  Direct air capture is a nascent industry. But over the past two years, tech firms vowing to erase their legacy of climate pollution have stoked new interest, as have oil companies that invested in the technology as a means of extracting more oil and hedging against a future where demand for fossil fuels plummets. If that link to the industry most responsible for climate change weren’t enough to make many environmentalists skeptical of direct air capture, the eye-popping projections for how much energy, water and land such facilities would require to suck CO2 from the sky at scale certainly do. While there’s debate over how many gigatons of carbon need to be removed from the atmosphere to keep global temperatures from surging past 1.5 degrees Celsius (from roughly 1.2 degrees today), many experts agree on the need to deploy technology like direct air capture. Taking the lead on that costly effort could show developing countries whose poverty and history of colonialism make limits to fossil fuel use politically unpalatable that the U.S. is, in fact, doing its part to clean up its two centuries of pollution.  “The ideal scenario, or at least a better scenario than the one we’re likely to get in the status quo, is that the U.S. returns to the Paris Agreement not simply ready to enforce stringent emissions standards, but really ready to commit serious research dollars in the short term and deployment dollars in the medium and long term to carbon removal,” said Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò, a researcher and assistant professor at Georgetown University who recently wrote an essay on why carbon removal would be good for African nations.  There’s earnest scientific debate over how much more carbon dioxide the atmosphere can absorb before locking in 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. At the end of 2017, U.N. scientists projected that a carbon budget of just 420 gigatons remained, and humanity has roughly spent that at a rate of 42 gigatons per year.  Removing some of that carbon while simultaneously halting increasing emissions would “expand the carbon budget available to developing countries,” Táíwò said.  “Low-income countries, developing countries, and small island states have different things at stake in the climate crisis, so there’s a better rationale for them doing what they need to do even if it means using existing technologies that emit carbon to take care of their populations,” he added. “Places like the U.S. and Canada have contributed an outsize amount of historical emissions that have accumulated in the atmosphere. So there’s a story to tell about responsibility.” ",The U.S. Is Officially Rejoining The Paris Agreement. Now Comes The Hard Part.
249,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/solar-panels-help-struggling-farms_n_5fff2427c5b691806c4e9fee,HP,Far Left,"As winter approached in 2018, a curious plot of vegetables planted beneath neat rows of sloping solar panels on stilts at Manzo Elementary School in Tucson was still going strong. Greg Barron-Gafford, an associate professor at the University of Arizona’s School of Geography, Development and Environment, and his research team had watched the plants flourish under the panels’ shade throughout the summer, one of the hottest on record, and he was eager to see how long they would last.  “We had basil and tomatoes go throughout the entire winter,” Barron-Gafford told HuffPost. “At that point, instead of being annual, they turned into perennial crops.” One of the basil plants grew over 8 feet tall. The student gardening group sold 9 gallons of pesto at a farmers market.  The productivity of the garden — part of the university’s Community School and Garden program ― provided encouraging results for Barron-Gafford’s research on “agrivoltaics”: growing food and generating solar energy on the same land. As renewable energy ramps up, the concept could at once help fulfill the need for land on which to build new solar installations while also helping farmers stay afloat in the face of converging stressors. U.S. farmland is on the decline: 11 million acres of farmland across the country were converted to residential use or taken over by cities and suburbs from 2001 to 2016, according to the American Farmland Trust, which works to preserve farms and ranchland. Farmers across the U.S. are struggling to make ends meet, and many can’t keep their businesses going. Climate change promises to make farming even harder by bringing on hotter and drier conditions, raising the need for irrigation while disrupting water supplies.   “These days [hay farming] doesn’t really pay for our property taxes plus water and utilities,” said Byron Kominek, whose family has been farming in Boulder, Colorado, for almost 50 years. Kominek hopes to revitalize the family business by reimagining it as an agrivoltaic farm that will harvest sunlight for both energy and food. Traditional solar farms conjure up an image of neat rows of deep blue panels angled toward the sky, hugging close to brown, bare ground. But increasingly, solar developers are exploring ways to “green” solar farms — planting grass, food crops or native vegetation to support pollinators under and around photovoltaic arrays. And scientists are finding that agrivoltaics could yield outsized benefits for farmers and energy companies. Agrivoltaic farms could not only help food and energy production to expand in harmony in land-scarce regions, but they could also help increasingly water-stressed agricultural regions save water. “It’s a case where one plus one could equal more than two,” Barron-Gafford said.  Renewable energy needs to rapidly replace greenhouse gas-emitting fossil fuels to keep up with energy demands while avoiding the most dire effects of climate change. Solar power, one of the fastest-growing sources of electricity in the world, is projected to lead renewable energy growth in the next decade. But it needs land. By 2030, researchers anticipate, nearly 2 million acres of land will be required for planned utility-scale solar projects in the U.S.   Farmlands are prime candidates for hosting solar arrays. The same conditions that make for good farming — lots of sun, light winds and moderate temperatures — lead to the highest solar energy yields. Solar developers also eye agricultural land because it is flat and comes with infrastructure such as roads and electrical connections, said Jordan Macknick, an analyst at the Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  But some farmers, seeing that panels have become more profitable than plants, have been criticized for turning over their cropland for the installation of solar. Macknick said he’s seen “a lot of pushback from rural and agricultural communities over the perception that solar projects are taking prime agricultural land out of production.” In parts of New York and Maryland, for instance, neighbors have fought solar development on farmland.  Rather than displace crops, solar systems could instead help keep farms alive — if both share the same land, said Drew Pierson, head of sustainability at Massachusetts-based solar developer BlueWave Solar. His company is working to help existing farms in New England earn revenue from solar power while maintaining their crops as much as possible.  “Agrivoltaics can be a way to strengthen the local food system by keeping farmers on the property,” Pierson said. BlueWave Solar is reaching out to farmers for permission to erect panels on their existing cropland instead of clearing land to build new solar arrays. The panels would be raised high off the ground and spaced apart to the planting of crops could continue. The farms may lose some land area for growing, Pierson explained, but they would receive regular rent from the solar array owners, providing a stable source of revenue. The energy generated would be sold to the local community.  The company will start building its first agrivoltaic project at Knowlton Farm in Grafton, Massachusetts, this month. In Boulder, Kominek, seeking ways to make his 24-acre farm more profitable, initially considered turning one of his three fields over to solar. Then he met Macknick and Barron-Gafford, who introduced him to agrivoltaics. “That made a lot of sense to me, and I thought: You know what? Let’s give it a go,” he said.  The farm — rechristened Jack’s Solar Garden, for Kominek’s grandfather who bought the family plot in 1972 — recently completed construction of two sets of solar panels erected 6 and 8 feet off the ground that will track the sun from east to west and generate 1.2 megawatts of power. Kominek will surround the array with native shrubs to host pollinators and plant vegetables underneath the panels in the spring. Macknick and Barron-Gafford will study the vegetation’s growth and the microclimates created below the panels. There’s not nearly enough data on agrivoltaic farms yet. But early evidence suggests that solar and agriculture could not only coexist, they might even mutually benefit. Certain crops may benefit from the panels’ protection, and solar panels benefit from having vegetation underneath them.  Shade from solar panels can alleviate heat and reduce water losses by slowing evaporation from the soil. “Plants are like humans: If we are under the sun, we have to drink more water,” said Pierre Genin, director of international affairs at French solar development company Sun’R. As far back as 10 years ago, intense sunlight and heat began degrading the taste and alcohol content of wine produced at vineyards in southern France, Genin said. Sun’R built a 2.2-megawatt solar array over 4.5 hectares of wine grapes at the vineyard Domaine de Nidoleres in 2018. The panels can be maneuvered to provide full sun in the morning and shade in the afternoon. The vines under the array used 20% less water, and the wine made from them has an improved acidity.  Findings like this could have important implications for growing food in a rapidly warming world. Climate change projections of drier and hotter conditions have prompted global interest in figuring out ways to grow crops under heat and water stress.  “In dryland environments and deserts around the world, plants have really great adaptations to live in such a high light and hot environment,” Barron-Gafford explained. “But most of our food crops don’t have those adaptations. They’re just cultivated plants that survive because we water them so much.”  In the arid climes at the University of Arizona, Barron-Gafford’s team documented how well tomatoes, jalapeños and chiltepin peppers — a high-value native crop that evolved to grow in the shade — performed when they were grown beneath solar panels. The benefits were clear: Tomatoes and chiltepin peppers produced double the fruit when they were shaded by solar panels compared with those that weren’t.  Barron-Gafford saw similarly encouraging results at Manzo Elementary. Despite being left untended for four months during the pandemic, the chiltepin peppers continued growing and had even germinated baby plants. “If a plant germinated, that tells you the environment was really good enough for it to do that.” In addition to shading vegetation from the harshest sun during the day, panels can also provide cover against frost at night, similar to how a carport or a tree prevents frost from forming on cars overnight. Being protected from both the hot sun and killing frosts, the crops underneath the university’s solar panels produced fruit throughout the summer and winter. Their longer growing season could explain their higher yields, Barron-Gafford said. On average, they also used about 30% less water. The plants improved the solar panels’ productivity, too: Panels with crops growing underneath them stayed cooler by about 16 degrees Fahrenheit and produced 2% more electricity than those without. The Southwest’s sunniness is a double-edged sword for photovoltaics. The region’s hot temperatures lower the amount of energy solar panels can produce, explained Macknick, who was also involved in the Arizona research study. For every 1 degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit) increase in temperature, solar panels lose nearly half a percent in efficiency. Having vegetation underneath solar panels keeps them cool because plants release water vapor through tiny pores on the underside of their leaves, a process called transpiration that cools down the plants’ leaves and the nearby air. “It’s a very unique positive feedback,” Barron-Gafford said. Not all crops are suitable for growing underneath solar panels. Broccoli, for instance, needs cold temperatures at night to signal the plant to grow florets. And large harvesting machinery can’t navigate around installations, making agrivoltaics inherently incompatible with crops like corn or hay. A lot more data is needed on how to make dual-use farming work in different climates and for various crops.  Conservationist Heidi Ricci of Massachusetts Audubon will be keeping an eye on the results. Her state, which has lost thousands of wild and farmed acres to solar development, offers aggressive financial incentives for agrivoltaic development. She worries that without adequate data, solar panels could wind up hurting the agricultural productivity of prime farmland. “This is all still very experimental in this region, so we don’t have a lot of real information yet,” she said. “We’re concerned about it gearing up on too much acreage before we really know a lot more about what’s going to work and what’s not.”  The Energy Department lab is coordinating and conducting research at 19 sites across the U.S. to figure out what vegetation — food crops, pasture grass for grazing or native vegetation to support pollinators — pairs best with solar in various situations. That information will be key to persuading more solar developers and farmers to try out agrivoltaics, said Macknick. “I think for some, it sounds like something that could really have multiple benefits, but they also don’t want to be the first one to do it.” One thing has become clear: Fertile ground beneath any solar array should not be left bare. “If you have those solar arrays and nothing growing, you’re losing a real opportunity there to draw down carbon to help balance the equation for greenhouse gases, in addition to losing the opportunity to grow crops or plants for pollinators,” suggested Florence Reed at Sustainable Harvest International, who isn’t involved in the agrivoltaic projects. Barron-Gafford is hopeful about the potential benefits of agrivoltaics for farmers, clean energy companies and the climate. “We learn so many times about the negative consequences of things we didn’t imagine, especially once we start to manipulate ecosystems or biology,” he said. “But this was a very pleasant surprise to find these positive interactions.”    HuffPost’s “Work in Progress” series focuses on the impact of business on society and the environment and is funded by Porticus.

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation first reported Sunday night that the Biden transition team may move to cancel the permit for the oil project via executive action, potentially on his first day in office. Sources told the outlet the Biden team had drafted an internal planning document with a slate of early executive actions meant to reverse environmental policies from the Trump era. Canada’s CTV and Reuters later confirmed the CBC’s reporting. The Keystone XL pipeline has been deeply controversial for more than a decade and faced a litany of legal challenges. If completed, it would carry up to 830,000 barrels of crude oil from Canada’s tar sands into Nebraska, where it would then be ferried to refineries along the Gulf of Mexico. Backers have touted the effort as a job creator, but environmental groups have lambasted the pipeline as a leaking contributor to climate change. The Biden transition team did not respond to a request for comment. The president-elect had previously said he was opposed to the project and his advisers said he would “proudly” move to block it once more. Reports of the move, however, quickly drew condemnation from officials in Canada. Jason Kenney, the premier of the province of Alberta, said he was “deeply concerned” by the reports, saying doing so would “kill jobs on both sides of the border” and “weaken the critically important Canada-U.S. relationship.” “As President-elect Biden’s green jobs plan acknowledges, Americans will consume millions of barrels of oil per day for years to come,” Kenney said in a statement. “It is in perfect keeping with his plan that the United States energy needs should be met by a country that takes the challenges of climate change seriously.” I am deeply concerned by reports that the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden may repeal the Presidential permit for the Keystone XL border crossing next week.My full statement: pic.twitter.com/vZjun1IdMH Canada’s ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, told Reuters the country would continue to lobby for the project, saying: “There is no better partner for the U.S. on climate action than Canada as we work together for green transition.”  The potential move was hailed by the environment group 350.org on Sunday night who said it was “a momentous sign that he is listening, taking action, and making good on his promises to people and the planet.” “By ensuring that KeystoneXL is reversed, Biden is standing on the side of tribal nations, farmers, ranchers, and many communities whose livelihoods would be wrecked by this dirty pipeline,” Kendall Mackey, a campaign manager for the group, said in a statement. “We look forward to working with the administration to ensure that real climate action that transitions us off fossil fuels and to a just renewable energy economy is a cornerstone of Biden’s legacy over the next four years.” President Donald Trump had touted the Keystone XL project as a major tenet of his administration, reversing an Obama-era ban on the project in 2017 over the outcry of environmental groups who said it would only stymie efforts to rein in climate change. Then-President Barack Obama had banned the pipeline in 2015. The future Biden administration will be full of heavy hitters when it comes to environmental policy. The president-elect announced a slate of respected staffers last week to spearhead green initiatives and tackle climate change.",Biden May Rescind Keystone XL Pipeline Permit On Day 1 In Office: Reports

A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokesperson told HuffPost that the agency is “investigating this matter.” The official noted that “harassing or harming a West Indian manatee in any way (including touching or writing on it) is a violation of the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act.” The animal did not appear to be seriously injured, according to the official. “West Indian manatees are essential members of the ecosystems in which they inhabit and are protected under the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act,” FWS Director Aurelia Skipwith said in a statement to HuffPost. Officials believed the word may have been scraped into the algae on the animal’s back. Jaclyn Lopez, Florida director at the Center for Biological Diversity, condemned the attack. “Manatees aren’t billboards, and people shouldn’t be messing with these sensitive and imperiled animals for any reason,” she said in a statement to HuffPost. “However this political graffiti was put on this manatee, it’s a crime to interfere with these creatures, which are protected under multiple federal laws.” The Florida-based nonprofit wildlife group Save the Manatee Club also blasted the attack. The club is “appalled at this disrespectful, harmful act toward an imperiled species,” the group said in a statement. “Based on the photos and videos available, it appears that the perpetrator may have scratched the manatee’s skin with their fingers, scraping the algae that grows on the slow-moving mammals,” the club explained. “They may have scraped the top layer of the manatee’s skin as well. Manatees have tough but sensitive skin, covered with tiny, sensory hairs ... it’s possible that this action may have caused the manatee discomfort or pain.” “The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service is investigating the harassment of a manatee...reported to federal authorities over the weekend discovered w/ words ""Trump"" scraped in its back ...discovered in Blue Hole on the Homosassa River” (via @CitrusChronicle )-Insurrectioning wildlife? pic.twitter.com/PvzI3pZ5Xn","'Guardians' Star Offers $20,000 Reward In 'Trump' Manatee Case"

253,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/direct-air-capture-climate-change-technology_n_5fffa043c5b691806c4f1c02,HP,Far Left,"As Nazi U-boats plagued the open sea in late 1940, the U.S. government launched an emergency shipbuilding program. In the first year, the program ramped up production at a breathtaking rate of 20% per month, supplying allies ― and eventually its own combat forces ― with about 6,000 vessels by the time World War II concluded five years later. Today the world faces a different kind of global threat, similarly metastasizing after years of failing to confront it. Keeping the planet from warming beyond recognition requires an unprecedented economic effort to halt climate-changing emissions. But even the most optimistic scientific projections call for not only stopping the output of carbon dioxide but also removing the vast concentrations of the gas already in the atmosphere, where it will continue to trap heat for more than a century to come.  New research set to publish Thursday in the journal Nature outlines how the U.S. government could once again conjure the full force of its industrial might to build and deploy a massive fleet of machines to suck CO₂ from the sky. Known as direct air capture, such technology could eventually extract roughly half the atmospheric CO₂ that United Nations forecasts show needs to be removed to keep the planet’s temperatures from surging to catastrophic levels. The machines essentially function like giant vacuum fans that pull carbon from the air and magnetically attach it to calcium or potassium molecules, transforming the emissions into a substance that can be injected underground for permanent storage, to prevent its return to the atmosphere. Like waging war, doing so will be extremely expensive and energy-intensive. But the University of California, San Diego, researchers set out in their peer-reviewed study to model what a wartime budget could do to boost a technology that today remains nascent and controversial.  The findings offer something of a thought exercise ― and a warning: Either jump-start the carbon removal industry with generous government support now, or risk playing desperate triage in the hotter, chaotic decades to come. At the moment, the technology is primarily produced by two companies ― Carbon Engineering, based in Canada, and Climeworks, headquartered in Switzerland ― that depend on working with major polluters. Carbon Engineering took money from oil giant Occidental Petroleum. Climeworks struck a deal to supply the Coca-Cola Co., the world’s biggest source of plastic pollution, with CO₂ for beverage carbonation.  The result has been a negative reputation among environmentalists and “minuscule” investment in a technology that most serious climate models suggest will be necessary in the years to come, said Ryan Hanna, an assistant research scientist at UC San Diego’s Center for Energy Research who was the study’s lead author. “If you look at the very basic growth numbers that would be required to deploy this kind of technology, you really need to start yesterday,” Hanna said. “It’s time that we’re working against, beyond just the amount of funding we can throw at the problem.”  President-elect Joe Biden vowed to inject $2 trillion into programs to convert the nation’s electricity supply to 100% zero-carbon sources by 2035, fund mountains of new research and build a massive network of charging stations for electric vehicles. A fraction of that funding would go to researching negative-emissions technologies like direct air capture.  Yet momentum is growing for a greater effort. On Thursday, a vast coalition of researchers from some of the nation’s top universities is set to publish a new website laying out a book-length primer on the need for carbon removal. And even some on the political left, where skepticism of direct air capture has been most pronounced, are now arguing that the technology could be used to “decolonize the atmosphere.” This study envisions spending about $1 trillion per year on direct air capture alone. That amounts to roughly 5% of the United States’ annual gross domestic product, a percentage the researchers gleaned from the average budget the country has spent fighting every major conflict since the Civil War. Then Hanna and his team looked at the maximum rate at which various technologies have been developed and deployed in times of crisis, including U.S. warships in the 1940s and French nuclear power plants in the aftermath of World War II, and arrived at 20% as a usable average.  “What’s being done in this paper is looking at the upper extreme for what we think would be possible, even if it’s a stretch,” Hanna said. “It truly is an upper bound, because upper bounds are instructive for showing what a crisis response could plausibly produce.”  By 2050, the study found, a direct air capture program expanded with that kind of money could remove 2 to 2.5 gigatons of CO₂ per year. Estimates from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the leading global climate forecasting body, vary on how much CO₂ needs to be removed from the atmosphere annually to keep warming in check, but most models suggest a figure close to 6 gigatons per year by midcentury. The rest would need to be made up with newly planted forests and styles of soil cultivation that trap carbon underground. (There is some debate among carbon removal researchers about whether that much will, in fact, be necessary.)   The conventional wisdom on negative emissions has so far been to focus on what can be done cheaply while directing government spending toward arresting the growth of emissions by replacing fossil-fueled transport and energy production with zero-carbon alternatives. But reaching those levels of emission removals by 2050 means going through a lot of costly trial-and-error in the next few decades. And though direct air capture requires prodigious amounts of energy to work ― demanding, at the scale modeled in the study, up to 25% of the nation’s electricity production ― existing sources of reliable, 24-hour power could render the technology affordable to run at present prices.  The study points to hydropower, nuclear and natural gas as the best options to run direct air capture plants at present, noting solar and wind will remain too intermittent until battery technology improves enough to sustain a powerful baseload of electricity. “If you have a long-term view that you want a fleet of direct air capture scrubbers to scale up and operate over the century, you actually shouldn’t be too concerned about what energy supplies are connected to initial deployments,” Hanna said. “In the grand scheme of things, emissions from the first few percent of plants don’t matter that much.”  The burden wouldn’t necessarily need to fall on the U.S. alone. The European Union, given its similar size to the U.S. economy, could take a lead role. The U.S. could also marshal its allies in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the 37-nation club of rich democracies, to aid in the effort.  Committing to remove some of the centuries of carbon emissions that countries such as the U.S., United Kingdom and France have produced since the dawn of the industrial revolution could prove a powerful tool in global climate negotiations. Developing nations such as China, India and Vietnam, whose emissions make up the bulk of those that could push the world over its climate threshold, have complained it’s unfair to demand they sacrifice fossil-fueled economic growth that lifts their populations out of poverty at the behest of countries that grew wealthy exploiting coal and colonizing their ancestors.  “Funds need to be invested today to accelerate the deployment of this technology, improve its technical performance and reduce the cost associated,” said Giulia Realmonte, a Milan-based researcher who has authored past studies on direct air capture for the Department of Energy. “We need to start talking about the climate crisis and getting ready to face it with all the ‘weapons’ we have.” But other studies suggest governments should focus first on transitioning electricity production to zero-carbon sources that could make direct air capture cheaper and less likely to add carbon pollution. “Large-scale decarbonization of the power sector, as well as direct and indirect electrification of other industries and technologies, should be prioritized as a cheaper climate change mitigation solution,” said Mahdi Fasihi, a researcher at Finland’s Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology who published a 2019 paper on the issue in the Journal of Cleaner Production.  Another issue would be maintaining such enormous government budgets over the course of decades.  “It’s important to make very clear where the government funding is going,” said Andrew Bergman, a doctoral student in applied physics at Harvard University. “It can go into the hands of folks like Occidental and Exxon who will make money managing the same waste they’ve created, or it can go to folks at the municipal level and union workers who work in a collective.” Samantha McCulloch, an analyst at the International Energy Agency, said finding ways to commercialize the technology could “offer an important backstop or hedge.” But markets have been slow to develop. The biggest commercial use of capture carbon dioxide at present is for enhanced oil recovery ― shooting captured CO₂ at high pressures into nearly exhausted oil wells to extract what remains. Houston-based Occidental has invested heavily in direct air capture in a bid to ultimately reposition itself as a “carbon management” company that difficult-to-decarbonize industries, such as airlines or cement makers, may someday pay to remove CO₂ emissions from the atmosphere.  But so far Occidental’s business remains primarily extracting fossil fuels to be burned.  “Look at what Carbon Engineering says when they’re criticized by environmental groups for working with oil companies,” Hanna said. “Their response is simple: If there were incentives from the government to do this without the oil and gas industry, to do it as a public good, we’d do it. But it’s just not there, so we need to go forth by any means possible to develop this technology.” ",Should We Spend $1 Trillion A Year On This Climate Technology? We May Have To.

On Tuesday, the local newspaper Citrus County Chronicle reported that a West Indian manatee discovered Sunday in the Homosassa River “had the word ‘Trump’ scraped into its back.” That same day, posts featuring photos and a video of a sea cow with President Donald Trump’s name “scraped” or “carved” into its back circulated on Twitter. ⚠️HELP FIND WHO MUTILATED A MANATEE: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is investigating who carved the word ""Trump"" on a Florida manatee.

It’s unclear if the manatee was physically hurt at all, marine biologist Ruth Carmichael from Dauphin Island Sea Lab told Vice News. “It’s a little hard to see the extent of damage from the video,” she said. “It is harassment, regardless. If the scrape penetrates the skin, then it likely caused some pain and stress. The animals have nerves and sensory hairs in the skin. Additionally, open wounds could become infected.” But even if no physical damage was done to the animal, the act is still likely a crime. “Harassing or harming a West Indian manatee in any way (including touching or writing on it) is a violation of the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act,” the FWS spokesperson said. The agency could not provide any photos or video of the harassed manatee. “West Indian manatees are essential members of the ecosystems in which they inhabit and are protected under the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act,” Aurelia Skipwith, director of the FWS, said in a statement sent to HuffPost. According to the FWS website, there are more than 6,300 manatees in Florida ― a significant increase from the estimated 1,267 in 1991. Yet it seems that 2020 wasn’t a great year for Florida manatees, the Miami Herald noted earlier this week. The newspaper reported that 10 manatees were crushed or drowned by floodgates and locks, per the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission’s preliminary mortality report. That is twice the number of manatees killed by flood control structures the previous year. And Florida boaters remained a huge threat to the survival of manatees, killing more than 130 in 2019 and at least 90 in 2020, according to the mortality report. Skipwith added in her statement that the federal agency is working closely with the state’s conservation commission.

Scientists have recently discovered a new way for them to get to you: climbing like a lasso. Researchers from Colorado State University and the University of Cincinnati inadvertently made the discovery while working on the conservation of Micronesian starlings, a native forest bird species threatened by invasive snake predation in Guam. As part of a new study, researchers had installed tall metal cylinders known as baffles on the island to prevent snakes and other predators like raccoons from climbing up to bird boxes. But brown tree snakes figured out a way around the barriers. “Initially, the baffle did work, for the most part,” Thomas Seibert of CSU, a co-author of the study, said in a press release. Seibert said he and a colleague had watched around four hours of video “and then all of a sudden, we saw this snake form what looked like a lasso around the cylinder and wiggle its body up.” “We watched that part of the video about 15 times. It was a shocker. Nothing I’d ever seen compares to it,” he added. The brown tree snake is native to Australia, Papua New Guinea, eastern Indonesia and several Pacific islands. It was introduced accidentally to Guam in the late 1940s or early 1950s. The reptiles have since decimated forest bird populations on the island and cause damage and power outages. Guam’s invasive tree snakes loop themselves into lassos to reach their feathered prey: https://t.co/QlXNp2f7PI pic.twitter.com/6leHkEjSWM The new finding has important implications for conservation. “Understanding what brown tree snakes can and cannot climb has direct implications for designing barriers to reduce the dispersal and some of the deleterious effects of this highly invasive species,” said Bruce Jayne of the University of Cincinnati, who also helped author the report. “Given that brown tree snakes can use lasso locomotion to defeat poles or cylinders of a certain size, we can design baffles to better protect birdhouses used for restoring some of Guam’s birds,” he said. Previously, snakes were known to have four different modes of movement: rectilinear, lateral undulation, sidewinding, and concertina. This new mode differs from the concertina mode snakes typically use to climb branches and pipes. The brown tree snakes use the lasso-like loop to form a single gripping region, using little bends within the loop to advance upwards slowly. But here’s the good news for the birds of Guam (and snake-haters everywhere): This way of climbing is apparently a struggle for the snakes. Researchers observed that the snakes move quite slowly, slip often, stop to rest and breathe heavily while climbing in this way. The study was published on Monday in the Current Biology journal.","Oh Good, Scientists Discovered Snakes Can Turn Their Body Into 'Lassos' To Climb"
256,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/san-diego-zoo-safari-park-gorillas-coronavirus_n_5ffceeeec5b6567198885576,HP,Far Left,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — Several gorillas at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park have tested positive for the coronavirus in what is believed to be the first known cases among such primates in the United States and possibly the world. The park’s executive director, Lisa Peterson, told The Associated Press on Monday that eight gorillas that live together at the park are believed to have the virus and several have been coughing. It appears the infection came from a member of the park’s wildlife care team who also tested positive for the virus but has been asymptomatic and wore a mask at all times around the gorillas. The park has been closed to the public since Dec. 6 as part of the state of California’s lockdown efforts to curb coronavirus cases. Veterinarians are closely monitoring the gorillas and they will remain in their habitat at the park, north of San Diego, Peterson said. For now, they are being given vitamins, fluid and food but no specific treatment for the virus. “Aside from some congestion and coughing, the gorillas are doing well,” Peterson said. While other wildlife has contracted the coronavirus from minks to tigers, this is the first known instance of transmission to great apes and it is unknown if they will have any serious reaction. Wildlife experts have expressed concern about the coronavirus infecting gorillas, an endangered species that share 98.4 percent of their DNA with humans and are inherently social animals. The gorillas infected at the San Diego safari park are western lowland gorillas, whose population has declined by more than 60% over the last two decades because of poaching and disease, according to the World Wildlife Fund. The safari park tested feces of the troop of gorillas after two apes began coughing Jan. 6. Positive test results were confirmed by the U.S Department of Agriculture National Veterinary Services Laboratories in three gorillas. Feces from all eight in the troop are being taken for testing. Zoo officials are talking to experts who have been treating the coronavirus in humans in case the animals’ develop more severe symptoms. They will remain together since separating them could be harmful to the gorillas that live in tight-knit groups. “This is wildlife, and they have their own resiliency and can heal differently than we do,” Peterson said. The safari park on Monday added more safety measures for its staff, including requiring face shields and eye goggles when working in contact with the animals. The confirmation that gorillas are susceptible to the coronavirus contributes to information about how the pandemic may affect these species in their native habitats where they come into contact with humans and human materials, the park officials said.

We lost power. The temperature inside plunged from 72 to 45 (and in some rooms it went below freezing). The next morning, when I was eating a burrito I’d made on a gas stove, the only utility still working, I heard what sounded like someone taking a shower upstairs. I ran up to see a torrent of ice-cold water falling into a bathroom from the ceiling. By the time I got downstairs, leaks were forming all over the first-floor ceiling. Our water pipes had burst. Everyone had stories like this. A neighbor’s second floor caved into the first floor from their own burst water pipe. A few blocks over, a friend’s water heater crashed through their attic into the kitchen. Across Texas, houses flooded and apartments fell apart. In the suburbs of Houston where I live, I saw neighbors scrambling to shut their water off, pack their families into cars, and flee. No pipes meant no water. Food was getting harder to find as icy roads and widespread power outages interrupted supply chains. There was no help, it seemed, as Texas’ infrastructure hurdled to total breakdown. It’s been just four years since Texas’ last “once in a century” disaster, and it’s the latest in a long line of previously unthinkable climate catastrophes along the Gulf Coast region. After each one, the recovery effort seems to go slower, take longer, and leave more people in the cold. Just last August, Hurricane Laura forced half a million to evacuate their homes as the storm ripped through the coast—causing particular harm in the Lake Charles, Louisiana, area, three hours from Houston. It was one of five storms that came ashore in Louisiana: About a month after Laura, Delta left mass devastation again in Lake Charles. Then a few weeks later, Zeta knocked out power in New Orleans for almost a week. The Gulf Coast has been cycling between crises with a growing awareness that it’s no longer treading water, but entering a slow death spiral. New Orleans, with its stalled recovery effort from Hurricane Katrina, is a local lesson. The city was never even given a chance to recover. Abandoned concrete towers in its downtown now cast shadows over the rest of the skyline. For us, the ice storm was watching the infrastructure fail, and our leaders fail, once more. It was hell. And it has begun to feel like a never-ending one. I learned that evening that Texas runs on its own power grid operated by a nonprofit called the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), and it was experiencing massive failures as coal and natural gas plants had partially frozen. The area ERCOT powers quickly came to demarcate the borders of our humanitarian disaster zone. (Now, we know that deregulation and a market-based approach led to not only disaster but profit. Massive energy bills are being handed down to customers throughout Texas for trying not to die.) My mom and I had managed to shut our water valves off early enough to prevent a total cave-in, but cracks formed all over the house. My feet, sloshing in the sour leaking water, were still numb. Two days after my water pipes burst, I asked my friend, who is a nurse at a large trauma center in Houston, how her hospital was doing. She told me there was some power but no water pressure. “Patients are sick with everything, some normal stuff, some stuff specific to this situation,” she said, noting entire families with carbon monoxide poisoning, house fires, people without dialysis, or home oxygen. “Desperate desperate people, people dying.” Her hospital, like others across Texas, were not only overwhelmed with patients but critically under-resourced to handle them. Almost half of the hospitals in southeastern Texas declared themselves suffering through “internal disasters” to dissuade ambulances from delivering patients. She said doctors and nurses were finding patients lying down on the floor of their homes for long stretches without food, water, or attention. “No one is able to check on them, help them with their chronic medical conditions. So just by the time they get to us they’re so so sick.” She text me two days later letting me know the ER was still overflowing with patients and their water remained unsafe for medical use due to the breakdown of Texas’ water treatment facilities. Without a meaningful ground presence by the local, state, or federal government, Houstonians turned to mutual aid groups who were aggressively deploying whatever resources they could despite their own homes facing collapse, floods, fires, and freezing cold leaks. I got into contact with Felix Kapoor, an organizer with West Street Recovery to try to interview him about the relief effort. The organization was set up initially after Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston with a record rainfall in 2016, but it had since become permanently mobilized when the rebuilding effort stalled and further climate crises hit Houstonians. The interview dissolved shortly after it started. I mentioned to Kapoor that my mom was hunting for new pipes outside the ERCOT disaster zone in Lake Charles, a full 170 miles from our house. “Could she get us some parts?” Kapoor asked quickly. I called and asked her. Kapoor told me what West Street needed. We coordinated to get PVC, CPVC, and copper pipes with couplings, which had already virtually disappeared from store shelves due to a run on plumbing material. There was no point in trying to get a bird’s eye view of this crisis. My drinking water was running low, my power was off, and my house was falling apart. The crisis was enveloping me, my family, and my entire community. Throughout the state, food and water had disappeared from shelves, gas stations were closed, and no one could find any propane or butane to keep their space heaters on. I texted with my grandparents, who are in their 80s. They’d been trapped alone in their house in College Station, Texas, for days with rolling blackouts. The inside of their house was hovering just above freezing. My grandmother’s appointment to get vaccinated was canceled. “I’m curious,” Kapoor told me over text one night, as interview lines continued to blur. “How many lives will it take or how many dollars of damage will occur before our elected officials realize that Houston needs to invest large attention and resources on disaster preparation?” I could barely parse the words. My body ached. I hadn’t showered for a week. My eyes shut. I awoke to see the official death hit 47, with many more likely to be added in the coming days. More and more of our lives along the Gulf are being twisted around trying to survive crises, then trying to rebuild with whatever pittance we make from our poverty wages, then preparing for the next storm knowing in the back of our heads we have no one but ourselves to rely on. Groups like West Street Recovery, initially organized to respond to one disaster event, are becoming mainstays. These crises are coming so often that they’re building on each other, flooding homes already weakened from last year’s hurricane season, or pushing over the skeleton of a local business that was deserted after a storm. What does recovery mean for us if the storm never stops? The only way to know a storm is not hitting you is if it’s hitting someone else. In November, I had driven through Lake Charles and seen piles of bricks blocking streets, hollowed-out carcasses of buildings sitting beside open businesses whose signs had been blown off their facades. I’d seen houses growing dark with mold bent to one side, and chunks of sheet metal laid in untilled fields by the highway. Now, my mom was waiting in line to buy plumbing supplies there, and she overheard a local Lake Charles resident quip from behind her, “Hey, at least we’re not in Houston.”",Texas’ Freeze Was One Part of a Long Disaster We’re Still Living Through
258,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/02/nevada-lithium-mine-kicks-off-a-new-era-of-us-extraction/,MJ,Far Left,"The Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone reservation in Humboldt County, Nevada.Russel Albert Daniels / High Country News This story was originally published by High Country News and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. In the Great Basin Desert of northern Nevada and southern Oregon, Thacker pass cuts a wide swath of sagebrush and bunch grasses between narrow ribbons of mountain ranges. The region is a caldera—a collapsed volcano—that formed an ancient lakebed. For millennia, Indigenous peoples used the verdant valley as a pathway between their winter and summer homes. Today, the Fort McDermitt Paiute Shoshone Tribe’s reservation is located nearby, along with the small agricultural community of Orovada, clusters of buildings surrounded by circular green fields of alfalfa. The ancient lakebed clays are rich in lithium, and in January, the Bureau of Land Management approved the Thacker Pass lithium mine, an almost two-square-mile open-pit mine that will dig up the nation’s largest-known lithium supply. The mine will be run by Lithium Nevada, a subsidiary of Canadian-owned Lithium Americas. But its approval was rushed through during the coronavirus pandemic, and tribal members, ranchers and environmentalists have concerns about the mine’s potential long-term consequences. Until now, lithium typically has been extracted from saline areas, such as Chile’s Atacama Desert, through an evaporative process. A relatively new technique using sulfuric acid to extract it from clay means the West is facing a new mining boom—and Nevada may soon be a global lithium-mining hotspot. Lithium, the lightest metal, shines silvery when stored in protective oils. (Otherwise, it’s extremely flammable.) That lightness makes lithium ion batteries essential to everything from cellphones, to tablets, to Teslas. Lithium ion batteries also store energy for much longer than other batteries, so they can be important parts of solar and wind energy systems.   Electrovoltaic, or EV, vehicles are a growing part of efforts to combat climate change. For example, General Motors announced in January that it planned to stop making combustion-engine cars by 2035. But as anyone with an aging cellphone knows, lithium ion batteries degrade over time. What’s more, companies seldom recycle the batteries to reuse the rare metals inside them; it’s more cost-effective simply to mine for more. In the Western United States, companies are rushing to develop lithium mines, partly because of new extraction methods, but also because the federal government is fast-tracking lithium mining. In 2018, the Interior Department listed lithium as a critical mineral, speeding up the mine permitting process. Last year, the Trump administration weakened and sped up the environmental review process for projects on federal lands, favoring mine approvals. Even as the Biden administration clamps down on extractive industries, such as by pausing oil and gas leases on public lands and offshore waters, lithium mining exploration continues apace, as part of the nation’s plan to wean itself from petroleum-powered cars. This sped-up approval process makes public participation hard. As early as 2019, the BLM published a notice online that invited public comments on the Thacker Pass project, but included the wrong internet link for information about it. In 2020, the BLM held virtual public meetings about the mine’s potential environmental impacts less than a month before the public comment period closed. According to E & E News, the environmental review, often a multiyear process, took less than a year, with the final public comment period held over the winter holidays. Although some commenters requested more time, citing the coronavirus pandemic, the Interior Department recommended expediting the mine’s approval to support economic recovery. Neither Lithium Nevada nor the Bureau of Land Management agreed to speak to High Country News about the project. Lithium Nevada will work approximately 18,000 acres of BLM land about 26 miles from the Fort McDermitt Paiute Shoshone Reservation, in a sea of sagebrush on the Nevada-Oregon border hemmed to the north by the Montana Mountains. The region is the traditional homeland of several related Indigenous nations, including the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of the Duck Valley Reservation, the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of the Fort Hall Reservation, the Fort McDermitt Paiute Shoshone Tribe and the Burns Paiute Tribe. Workers will build the mine 24 hours a day for the first two years. Starting in the second year, actual mining operations—such as digging the open-pit mine, pumping the ore to a processing facility, processing the lithium in industrial scrubbers, hauling waste rock to a stockpile, and trucking in materials to make sulfuric acid—will occur 24 hours a day for four decades. In a region where the average 2019 salary was about $21,000, Lithium Nevada says the mine’s average salary will be nearly quadruple that. The company predicts it will bring approximately 1,000 construction jobs to the region for two years of construction, and employ an operational staff of about 300 until the mine closes. The mine has been approved to run for about 40 years—longer, if the company finds more lithium. Fort Mcdermitt Paiute Shoshone Tribal Councilperson Maxine Redstar hopes the mine will provide well-paid, highly skilled work to the reservation’s isolated community of approximately 340 people. But details about those jobs are scarce. Lithium Nevada is working closely with the tribe to do outreach and has worked with Great Basin Community College to develop construction training. In its environmental impact statement, however, it describes plans to bus operational workers in from Winnemucca, an hour away from the mine, where the population is less than 4% Native American. Throughout 2020, the Fort McDermitt Paiute Shoshone Tribe contended with devastating coronavirus infection rates, and Redstar hopes that Lithium Nevada will commit to more community engagement, such as the youth summit and powwow Redstar organized with financial support from the company. Previously, she worried that the much-needed economic stimulus would come at too high a cost, either to local communities or the environment, impacting native habitat, cultural foods, or the wild game that some tribal members still hunt traditionally. But at a February tribal council meeting, Lithium Nevada reassured Redstar that it will seriously consider any concerns raised by the tribe. “They are going to be doing reclamation every seven years,” Redstar said. “I’m feeling a little bit confident that they are doing everything they can to restore the way it was going to be.” Lithium Nevada also said they would help identify what kind of professional training tribal members needed in order to be employed at the Thacker Pass mine. Still, others worry that the tribe doesn’t have enough information about the mine’s possible consequences, good or bad. Tribal Councilmember Billy A. Bell said he only learned about the mine’s approval by the BLM after High Country News asked for his comments. “It’s interesting how the tribe didn’t comment” on the project, Bell said. “And it’s too late now.” This rushed approval process has frustrated local rancher Edward Bartell. Bartell’s family—fifth- or sixth-generation ranchers—has run cattle in Thacker Pass for a dozen years. His family’s cattle graze private property, where sturdy Great Basin wild rye sways across acres of land. Bartell believes that the project’s fast approval means that the BLM relied on the mining company for all the science, and he worries about the mine’s long-term effects on the region’s air and water quality. Bartell didn’t start out opposed to the mine—in fact, the green energy angle sounded good to him. But as he looked into the potential impacts on his family business, he started to get worried. “My big thing is the BLM hasn’t done any other independent science,” Bartell said.  Bartell has not found direct communications with the company reassuring. For example, in an email sent in November 2019, Alexi Zawadzki, president of Lithium America’s North American operations, told him, “You’ll be pleased to know our operation will use very little water—approximately 2,500 acre-feet of well water per year.” However, when Bartell read the BLM’s final environmental impact statement, he learned that that estimate was for just the first four years of operation. After that, the mine will use twice as much water.   Bartell fears that the water table will drop dramatically. “It is a big devaluation of land value, if you have productive grassland, like you’re seeing out here, and suddenly it turns into barren dustbowl,” Bartell said. He has asked Lithium Nevada to compensate his business, but to no avail. In February, Bartell sued the BLM for rushing the environmental review. He also worries about the approximately 5,800 tons of sulfuric acid the mine will eventually produce on-site each day. To make sulfuric acid, Lithium Nevada will ship the necessary chemicals in via rail to Winnemucca. From there, trucks will rumble down quiet roads, making up to 200 trips day and night between the town and mine facility—carrying hazardous materials to the mine’s on-site processing center, and mine products back to the railroad. “What they’re going to have is more of an industrial facility here than just a mine. It’s going to have a chemical complex as well,” said John Hadder, director of the nonprofit Great Basin Resource Watch. “So there’s a lot of concerns about emissions, air quality, leaks, spills, all that kind of stuff.” The fast-tracked approval process means that the BLM produced scant details about how the mine will affect rare species or unique habitat. The greater sage grouse, for example, stands to lose thousands of acres of habitat. A sage grouse lek, or courtship area, lies less than a mile from the future mine. Even federal biologists have expressed concern about the rapid approval process. In a January letter to the Bureau of Land Management, Environmental Protection Agency project manager Jean Prijatel questioned the plan for long-term management after the mine closes down. According to Prijatel, without proper management, the mine will contaminate local groundwater with dangerous heavy metals, in particular a “plume” of antimony, for at least 300 years. Prijatel noted that though the BLM had “conceptual options” to address this plume, it offered no detailed mitigation plans, yet approved the mine anyway. She also questioned how the mine will monitor water pollution or share that information with the public. Prijatel did not respond to a request for comment from High Country News, although an EPA representative offered to answer questions provided in writing. Hadder explained that the mine will eventually be dug deeper than the groundwater level. To keep it dry, the mining company will have to continuously pump water out. When the mine shuts down and the pumping stops, groundwater will seep back in, picking up newly exposed toxins, such as antimony. Lithium Nevada plans to treat groundwater for antimony pollution caused by the mine for several years after it closes. But Hadder worries that the antimony pollution may last far longer. “It has the potential of being an intergenerational pollution source, requiring perpetual management,” he said. “This is something that’s not getting a lot of play. And I think it’s part of the problem with the whole process, in not really giving people a full sense of what could happen.”",A Nevada Lithium Mine Kicks Off a New Era of US Extraction
259,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/02/nuclear-energy-climate-change-nuscale-green-power-uranium/,MJ,Far Left,"For six weeks in early 2006, engineers drilled nearly 3,000 holes into the 499-foot-tall cooling tower at the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant outside of Rainier, Oregon, and filled them with 2,800 pounds of dynamite. Early on May 21, a 2.5-second explosion echoed through the surrounding hills. Cheers erupted from the dozens of anti-nuclear activists who had come to watch the demolition from across the Columbia River. The effort to topple Oregon’s nuclear industry had been years in the making. The Trojan plant, which came online in 1975, featured the largest reactor ever built. Twice in the 1970s, picketers blocked workers from entering the plant. Four years after it opened, the partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island facility in Pennsylvania spooked the nation, and Oregon, like many states, put a moratorium on new nuclear plants. By the time Trojan was blown up, the industry was over, at least locally. Or so it seemed. In 2007, an engineer at Oregon State University named José Reyes began to resurrect it by imagining a reactor that would be “very, very different.” By shrinking and simplifying the standard nuclear reactor, Reyes believes he has created a technology that can generate power more safely at a fraction of the price. Last August, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a final safety report for Reyes’ design, recommending its certification. Construction on the first reactor could begin as soon as 2025. That puts NuScale, the company Reyes co-founded, at the front of the race toward “advanced nuclear” power—a technology that advocates say will be essential to the transition away from fossil fuels. Donald Trump’s Department of Energy was “all in” on advanced nuclear, as a press release put it, pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into research and development. President Joe Biden is a fan, too. As part of his plan to shift the United States to 100 percent clean energy by 2050, he has targeted further investment in small modular nuclear reactors like NuScale’s. But are these investments worth the money—and the risks? New designs or not, nuclear plants face daunting issues of waste disposal, public opposition, and, most of all, staggering costs. We must ramp up our fight against climate change. But whether nuclear is a real part of the solution—or just a long-shot bid to keep a troubled industry alive—is a debate that will come to the fore in the short window we have to overhaul the nation’s energy portfolio. Few issues divide us as cleanly as nuclear power. According to a 2019 Pew Research Center poll, 49 percent of Americans support opening new plants, while 49 percent are opposed. The popular argument against nuclear power can be summed up in a few names: Chernobyl. Fukushima. Three Mile Island. Nuclear dread is palpable. Some formerly pro-nuclear countries, like Germany, began phasing out plants in the wake of the 2011 disaster in Japan. The dangers begin well before nuclear fuel arrives at a plant, and persist long afterward; the rods that fuel today’s plants remain radioactive for millennia after their use. How to ethically store this waste remains a Gordian knot nobody has figured out how to cut. The argument in favor of nuclear power boils down to the urgent need to combat climate change. The United States’ 94 nuclear reactors provide about half of our carbon-free power. Like coal- and natural gas–fired plants, they supply a steady amount of energy, no matter the weather. Advocates also point out that in terms of deaths per unit of energy, nuclear is on par with renewable plants as one of the safest forms of energy available. But if nuclear power is going to help us mitigate climate change, a lot more reactors need to come online, and soon. Eleven nuclear reactors in the United States have been retired since 2012, and eight more will be closed by 2025. (When nuclear plants are retired, utility companies tend to ramp up production at coal- or natural gas–fired plants, a step in the wrong direction for those concerned about lowering emissions.) Since 1970, the construction of the average US plant has wound up costing nearly three-and-a-half times more than the initial projections. Developers have broken ground on just four new reactor sites since Three Mile Island. Two were abandoned after $9 billion was sunk into construction; two others, in Georgia, are five years behind schedule. The public is focused on risks, but “nuclear power is not doing well around the world right now for one reason—economics,” says Allison Macfarlane, a former commissioner of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Nuclear was not always so troubled. In the 1950s, some environmentalists advocated “atoms not dams,” preferring nuclear plants to hydropower projects that destroyed wild landscapes. Until Three Mile Island, public support was strong. Dozens of plants came online. In the 1970s, Reyes, seeing an industry full of promise, decided to pursue a degree in nuclear engineering. After a decade of working at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in 1987 Reyes went to teach at Oregon State University, where he built a model of the Trojan plant’s reactor, scaling down its pipes and chambers to examine what might happen if its cooling pumps failed. After he presented his findings at a conference, Westinghouse—then one of the biggest builders of nuclear reactors—tapped Reyes to analyze its technology. Under his lead, Oregon State eventually became what he calls “the Consumer Products Safety Commission for the nuclear industry.” Reyes was determined to simplify reactors. The conventional model is a giant tangle of tubes, any of which might fail. In a plant’s control room, operators monitor hundreds of data sources at once; Reyes sees this oversupply of information as a needless source of stress. So he designed a smaller, more streamlined reactor. The university, which still hosts NuScale’s test facilities, helped him commercialize his idea. When I visited NuScale before the pandemic hit, most of the company’s 400 employees worked out of a stucco building on the outskirts of Corvallis. Reyes’ office looks out toward the Oregon Coast Range. Now in his mid-60s, he is soft-spoken but energetic. On his gray blazer, he wore a pin with the company’s logo: an N composed of atomlike dots. A nuclear reactor, he explained, is like a giant teakettle—it’s just a mechanism for boiling a whole lot of water. The heat comes from metal fuel rods, filled with uranium pellets, which are immersed in water inside the reactor core. The fuel is hit with neutrons, causing the uranium atoms to split, one after another, in a chain reaction that releases tremendous heat. The water does double duty: It carries the heat into a steam generator, where another batch of water is boiled and sent into turbines that produce electricity. The water also functions as a coolant, preventing the fuel rods from growing so hot that they melt. The most famous nuclear disasters have all been caused, at least in part, by failed cooling systems: Water could not be pumped back into the core quickly enough to protect the fuel. Reyes aims to reduce the likelihood of such a catastrophe by placing the reactor core and steam generator inside a much smaller containment vessel, reducing the amount of exterior piping and thereby the number of places where coolant can escape. Instead of relying on pumps and motors to push water through the reactor, as is typical, Reyes’ system is passive and less dependent on human intervention. For instance, the NuScale reactor features valves that flip open automatically if power fails, sending water back into the reactor core to cool it. Reyes also shrank the reactor—by a lot. All of a NuScale reactor’s components will be housed in a shell that is just 76 feet tall—twice the height of a typical telephone pole—and 15 feet wide. More than 100 of these shells could be packed inside a conventional nuclear reactor containment building. A typical NuScale plant will consist of 4 to 12 reactors in their shells, all surrounded by a large pool of water, one more layer of protection. Each reactor will generate up to 77 megawatts of energy, which means a “12 pack” will produce nearly as much power as a traditional 1,000-megawatt reactor. Their small size, though, means these new nuclear plants can replace old coal plants on the same site, plugging right into the existing grid—an enormous cost savings. NuScale’s small, modular design allows several reactors to be housed together to form power plants of various sizes.  Remie Geoffroi This reimagined nuclear plant, Reyes says, will supplement renewable power. Right now, the United States turns to wind and solar power for less than 10 percent of its energy. While the price of renewables has been dropping, relying on wind and solar for all of our energy needs would depend on battery storage and other technologies that aren’t yet ready. Until they are, backup facilities would be required to ensure power never drops because of a cloudy or windless day. The question is what path we want to follow to get to zero emissions: Do we build a huge number of solar and wind-powered plants, enough to ensure power is always coming from somewhere? Or build fewer such plants and supplement them with a baseload supply of steady electricity from a handful of nuclear facilities. A recent study by a consortium of utilities found that this second approach could drop the price of supplying carbon-free energy to the Pacific Northwest by $8 billion a year—though only if NuScale can keep its costs as low as it has promised. Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems, a state-owned agency that sells electricity across six Western states, is betting that it can. The agency, which aims to offer its members the choice of fully carbon-free power, sees NuScale as the best available option for undergirding its existing wind and solar plants. In 2015, UAMPS announced a plan to build 12 NuScale reactors at the federally run Idaho National Laboratory. NuScale projected total construction costs at $3 billion—nearly a third less than the most recently completed US reactor, which came online in 2016 at a cost of $4.7 billion (though it will supply more power). And the next plant should cost even less, since NuScale’s small reactors will be built on an assembly line, rather than on-site. But the price will drop only if more customers buy them. “Taxes are more popular than nuclear power,” jokes Doug Hunter, the CEO of UAMPS. To change that perception, Hunter and his team have spent the last few years visiting towns and utility companies that buy power from UAMPS, explaining the potential role of nuclear power and the safety of NuScale’s design. His persistence paid off. By 2020, the majority had signed on to the NuScale project—though only as long as they had plenty of chances to back out if the project went south. 
The day after I visited NuScale, I drove north to Rainier to tour what’s left of the Trojan nuclear plant. Power lines overhead disappeared into mist-shrouded hills, and geese squawked alongside a 29-acre lake in a quiet, wooded park. Portland General Electric, the plant’s owner, secures the 34 casks that hold the plant’s old fuel behind a chain-link fence. Otherwise, there is no marker indicating the site’s history. The cooling tower, once visible for miles, has been gone for more than a decade.
Lloyd Marbet, one of the activists who helped ensure the tower’s demolition, moved to Oregon in 1969 as a young anti-­war protester. He soon became an anti-nuclear organizer, too, and in 1980 was involved in a campaign to ban construction of more nuclear plants in Oregon until there was a permanent waste disposal facility (though Marbet had hoped to go further and ban the technology entirely). A ballot measure he championed narrowly passed, and the law remains in effect.
I met up with Marbet over lunch at an organic cafe and then trailed his orange, electric BMW to the office of the Oregon Conservancy Foundation, the latest nonprofit he directs. Built in a shipping container and sheathed in aluminum insulation, the office felt like the cluttered, homey cockpit of a spaceship that might be able to manage the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs.
Marbet admires the science of nuclear reactors; when he toured Trojan in the 1970s, he was impressed by its engineering. But he insists there is no perfect mousetrap. Even with new technology, we will need to mine uranium—a process that has leached radioactive waste into waterways—and find somewhere to put the spent fuel. (The current practice, which persists at Trojan and will be employed at NuScale’s plants, is to hold waste on-site. This is intended to be a temporary measure, but every attempt to find a permanent disposal site has been stalled by geological constraints and local opposition.) Marbet believes we need to transition away from coal and gas immediately. But he worries that nuclear is too expensive, and a new round of investment might pull money away from more effective, and cleaner, solutions.
In the years after Oregon’s ban on new plants, Marbet and his allies wrote three more ballot measures aimed at shuttering Trojan. Their campaigns highlighted the plant’s safety and design flaws, and featured sealed court transcripts that an anonymous source had delivered to Marbet in 1989, wrapped in a paper bag. Those memos showed that Trojan’s builders had hired a wildly underqualified engineer to design some essential buildings—mistakes caught only after the facility was complete.
Despite such evidence, all three ballot measures were defeated. Then, in 1993, just months after the last campaign, Portland General Electric discovered leaking steam tubes inside the plant. They decided to close it forever—less than halfway through its operational life. “I had people come up to me on the street and say, ‘Jeez, you know, we thought you were full of it, but now we see that the concerns that you were raising were legitimate,’” Marbet told me.
These days, he’s watching the industry creep back. A Republican state senator named Brian Boquist has proposed a bill three times that would permit city or county voters to exempt themselves from the 1980 law, allowing a nuclear facility to be built within their borders. (The bill has failed twice; the latest version is with the senate committee.) Boquist does not seem particularly committed to fighting climate change: He and other members of the Republican minority refused to show up to vote on a cap-and-trade bill in early 2020, causing the Senate to fall short of a quorum. (When Gov. Kate Brown threatened to retrieve legislators using state troopers, Boquist said to “send bachelors and come heavily armed.”)
In 2017, as the legislature debated Boquist’s first pro-nuclear bill, Marbet testified that NuScale was making “an end run around [voters] in their quest for corporate profit.” He also noted the company’s ties to the Fluor Corporation. The Texas-based multinational engineering firm that has been NuScale’s majority owner since 2011 has invested $9.9 million in campaign contributions over the past 30 years, with nearly two-thirds going toward Republican candidates. (Fluor is currently under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission due to allegedly sloppy accounting practices.)
Marbet admits his view of the industry is jaundiced, but his experiences make him skeptical of NuScale and its claims. He worries, too, that if small reactors take off, operators will revert to old habits, cutting corners to make a buck. He points to a draft rule approved last year by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, over the objections of FEMA, that would reduce the size of the emergency planning zone around nuclear plants: Rather than a 10-mile-wide circle, a plant would only need an evacuation plan for the space within its fence lines. NRC commissioner Jeff Baran opposed the change, noting it is based on assumptions about small reactors, like NuScale’s, that remain on the drawing board, and might open the door to weakening safety standards for existing plants.
Old-line environmental groups like Greenpeace and the Sierra Club remain staunchly opposed to nuclear power, but politicians have been more open to it. President Barack Obama was an outspoken proponent of nuclear’s potential. For 2020, the Senate Appropriations Committee unanimously agreed to spend more than President Trump requested on nuclear research, and the Senate is currently considering a bipartisan bill that will streamline the permitting process and establish a national uranium reserve.
Now, as part of his $2 trillion climate plan, Biden is calling for a federal research agency that would pursue carbon-free energy sources, including small reactors. Biden’s was the first Democratic Party platform in 48 years that explicitly supported an expansion of nuclear energy. His pick to lead the Department of Energy—which devotes the majority of its budget to nuclear projects—is former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, who has little experience in the field. Gina McCarthy, the former EPA administrator who is Biden’s chief domestic climate coordinator, has said that nuclear could play a key role in baseload power supply but indicated that waste disposal issues ought to be resolved before the technology is widely adopted.
Biden’s was the first Democratic Party platform in 48 years that explicitly supported an expansion of nuclear energy.
NuScale is not the only player: Currently, seven companies are in discussions with the NRC about advanced reactor designs. Last March, a Silicon Valley startup called Oklo applied for a license to build and operate a plant that uses liquid metal as a coolant. This might allow some old fuel rods to be reused—though some scientists worry it could create new and more dangerous kinds of waste. If it meets its ambitious timeline, Oklo will beat NuScale to market. But Oklo’s “microreactor” will only generate 1.5 megawatts, enough to power 1,000 homes, whereas NuScale’s first plant will produce hundreds of times more power. The company is targeting small, remote communities in regions like northern Alaska. Ahmed Abdulla, a researcher working with the University of California, San Diego’s Deep Decarbonization Initiative, calls this a “niche” technology, unlikely to contribute widely to the national grid. He doubts that any of the current designs are likely to be widely adopted in the next few decades—NuScale’s included. The economics, he says, “render nuclear virtually irrelevant in the US.”
A major hurdle for any advanced nuclear product is the regulatory process. NuScale spent more than $500 million developing its licensing application. The path to approval has consumed 12 years already, and it’s not over yet. In the months after my visit to NuScale, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission noted “several potentially risk-significant” questions that remain unanswered about the company’s reactor design, especially about its new version of a steam generator. Nonetheless, the NRC granted its initial approval of the design at the end of the summer; now NuScale awaits official, final certification by the commissioners, which is expected sometime this year. But further analysis of the generators will be required before a license is granted to actually build a plant.
A decade ago, NuScale suggested it might have a plant in operation by 2018. Now construction won’t begin until 2025 at the earliest. The plant at Idaho National Laboratory won’t be fully operational until 2030. Factoring in interest and other costs not included in NuScale’s $3 billion estimate, UAMPS expects a total 40-year lifetime cost of $6 billion for the plant. Some critics see this as the same old story: grand, early promises—a “dog and pony show,” as Marbet calls NuScale’s PR—followed by cost overruns and delays. Reyes intentionally used materials familiar to regulators, so as to speed along the process. But other advanced reactor designs, which use new kinds of fuel and coolant, may face an even slower and more expensive journey.
Recently, nine towns—more than a quarter of the subscribed members—pulled out of UAMPS’s project after changing their minds about their energy needs or worrying that it was becoming a financial sinkhole. (Meanwhile, one new town signed on.) The plant’s economics depend on running near full capacity, which will only happen if utilities outside of UAMPS also buy some of its power. The Department of Energy says it will chip in nearly $1.4 billion over the next nine years, which should help bring down the cost of the plant’s energy. But the projected price—$55 per megawatt-hour—is still above the current costs for solar and wind projects. And the federal money will require annual congressional approval. It’s possible that other new ideas might pop up, competing for limited dollars.
Biden’s climate plan hinges on a massive expenditure on research. What his administration will have to quickly decide, though, is how to divvy that pot. Allison Macfarlane, the former NRC commissioner, told me other industries deserve far more of our resources and attention than nuclear. Batteries, in particular, could steady out the uneven flow of renewables. They may even work better, since nuclear plants are difficult to power up or down in response to changing conditions. Once a pie-in-the-sky idea, battery storage now offers costs at least “in the ballpark” of nuclear, says Stan Kaplan, a former US Energy Information Administration analyst. Prices have dropped 70 percent in the past few years and are projected to drop another 45 percent before NuScale’s plant comes online. California—which also has a moratorium on nuclear builds—is rapidly expanding its storage capacity. Within 10 years, the niche that Nu­Scale is aiming for might already be filled.
But nuclear proponents say we still need “an enormous amount of hedges,” as Josh Freed, vice president of the think tank Third Way, put it to me. For nuclear to persist as a hedge, it all but requires government assistance, given the enormous upfront costs of R&D. Another challenge is vetting which projects have real promise. “You have all these reactor vendors pitching their wares, and making all sorts of outrageous and false claims,” says Edwin Lyman, the director of nuclear power safety with the Union of Concerned Scientists. These claims have also been the basis of lowering safety standards, which offers a large indirect subsidy for operators. There needs to be a stronger peer-review process, he says, to make sure the government is only sponsoring truly worthwhile projects.
A recent study from Princeton found that even without nuclear power, the relative cost of a decarbonized energy system in 2050 could be about the same as in 2015, which at the time was a historic low. The study found nuclear could reduce costs even further—if it becomes as cheap as its advocates hope. But Abdulla, the UC San Diego researcher, has calculated that in order to make advanced reactors accessible within the next few decades—even relatively simple reactors, like NuScale’s—the government would need to provide hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies and substantially simplify the regulatory process. Abdulla believes nuclear energy should have been “an arrow in our quiver.” But given the economics, he says, “I fear the arrow has broken.”
That makes for a strange moment. No existing clean energy source is quite so scalable as nuclear, which is why engineers are bullish. And if money were no object—if we could snap our fingers and scatter reactors across the landscape—we would take a huge step toward curbing emissions. But if Abdulla’s numbers are right, the nuclear dream looks dead on arrival. For many, that feels like relief: We can shake off our nuclear dread. But it should be bittersweet, too. It’s a door closed, after all, and until we know another has opened, the changing climate gives us plenty else to fear.

260,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/02/scientists-accidentally-discover-strange-creatures-under-a-half-mile-of-ice/,MJ,Far Left,"The animals were found in a remote drill site on the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf.British Antarctic Survey Bivouacked in the middle of the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf—a five-hour flight from the nearest Antarctic station—nothing comes easy. Even though it was the southern summer, geologist James Smith of the British Antarctic Survey endured nearly three months of freezing temperatures, sleeping in a tent, and eating dehydrated food. The science itself was a hassle: To study the history of the floating shelf, he needed seafloor sediment, which was locked under a half mile of ice. To get to it, Smith and his colleagues had to melt 20 tons of snow to create 20,000 liters of hot water, which they then pumped through a pipe lowered down a borehole. It took them 20 hours to melt through the ice inch by inch, finally piercing through the shelf. Next, they lowered an instrument to collect the sediment, along with a GoPro camera. But the collector came back empty. They tried once more. Still empty. Again, nothing comes easy here: Each round trip of the instrument took an hour. Later that night in his tent, Smith watched the footage and recognized a rather glaring problem. The video shows a descent through 3,000 feet of blue-green ice, which suddenly terminates, opening up into dark seawater. The camera coasts another 1,600 feet until the seafloor finally comes into view—mostly light-colored sediment, which Smith was after, but also something dark. That dark thing turned out to be a rock, which the camera hits with a thud, tumbling face-down into the sediment. The camera quickly rights itself and scans the rock, revealing something the geologists hadn’t been after at all. In fact, it was something highly improbable: life. “It’s like, bloody hell!” Smith says. “It’s just one big boulder in the middle of a relatively flat seafloor. It’s not as if the seafloor is littered with these things.” Just his luck to drill in the only wrong place. Wrong place for collecting seafloor muck, but the absolute right place for a one-in-a-million shot at finding life in an environment that scientists didn’t reckon could support much of it. Smith is no biologist, but his colleague, Huw Griffiths of the British Antarctic Survey, is. When Griffiths watched the footage back in the UK, he noticed a kind of film on the rock, likely a layer of bacteria known as a microbial mat. An alien-like sponge and other stalked animals dangled from the rock, while stouter, cylindrical sponges hugged the surface. The rock was also lined with wispy filaments, perhaps a component of the bacterial mats, or perhaps a peculiar animal known as a hydroid. The rock Smith had accidentally discovered is 160 miles from daylight—that is, the nearest edge of the shelf, where ice ends and the open ocean begins. It’s hundreds of miles from the nearest location that might be a source of food—a spot that would have enough sunlight to fuel an ecosystem, and be in the right position relative to the rock for known currents to supply these creatures with sustenance. Not to tell life its business, but it’s got no right being here. “It’s not the most exciting-looking rock—if you don’t know where it is,” says Griffiths, lead author of a new study published in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science. Since you now do know, then it means your jaw may be somewhere near the floor right about now. We can say for certain that these animals are living in total darkness, which is fine—plenty of deep-sea critters do the same. But animals that live sessile (read: stuck in place) existences on the deep sea floor must rely on a fairly steady supply of food in the form of “marine snow.” Every living thing swimming in the water column above must one day die, and when they do, they sink to the depths. As the corpses descend and decompose, other creatures pick at them and fling off particles, tiny morsels that accumulate even on the deepest of sea floors. (When a whale dies and sinks, by the way, it’s epically known as a “whale fall.”) This works in most parts around Antarctica, where the waters are incredibly productive. Tiny critters known as plankton feed all kinds of fish, which feed large marine mammals like seals. All this activity produces detritus—and dead animals—that one day become marine snow. But the Antarctic critters on this particular rock don’t live under a bustling water column. They live under a half-mile of solid ice. And they can’t roam away from their rock in search of food. “The worst thing in a place where there’s not much food, and it’s very sporadic, is to be something that’s glued to the spot,” says Griffiths. So how on Earth could they be getting sustenance? Stalked animals (bottom left) and sponges (top right).  British Antarctic Survey The researchers think it’s likely that the drift of this marine snow has been flipped on its side, so that the food source is moving horizontally instead of vertically. Looking at charts of currents near the drill site, the researchers determined that there are productive regions between 390 and 930 miles away. It may not be much, but it’s possible that enough organic material is riding these currents hundreds of miles to feed these creatures. That’s an extraordinary distance, given that in the deepest part of the ocean, the Challenger Deep near Guam, marine snow produced at the surface has to fall 7 miles down to reach the seafloor. To reach the animals on this Antarctic rock, food would have to travel as much as 133 times that distance—and it would have to do so by floating sideways. Given what scientists know about currents around Antarctica, this isn’t particularly far-fetched, says Rich Mooi, curator of invertebrate zoology and geology at the California Academy of Sciences, who has studied Antarctic sea life but wasn’t involved in this new work. As seawater cools in the region, it grows more dense. “It sinks to the sea bottom and pushes water outward, radiating outward from the Antarctic,” says Mooi. “And these currents are actually the germ of many—if not almost all of—the current systems on the planet.” As that water pushes outward, something has to fill the void. “There’s going to be some inflow to replace that,” Mooi adds. “And that inflow, even over hundreds of kilometers, is going to carry organic matter.” For our lifeforms stuck on that boulder, this would bring food. The currents could also bring new animals to add to the population on the rock. But because the researchers couldn’t collect specimens, they can’t yet say what exactly these sponges and other critters could be eating. Some sponges filter organic detritus from the water, whereas others are carnivorous, feasting on tiny animals. “That would be sort of your headline of the year,” says Christopher Mah, a marine biologist at the Smithsonian, who wasn’t involved in the research. “Killer Sponges, Living in the Dark, Cold Recesses of Antarctica, Where No Life Can Survive.” And Griffiths and his team also can’t yet say if mobile creatures like fish and crustaceans also live around the rock—the camera didn’t glimpse any—so it’s not clear if the sessile animals face some kind of predation. “Are they all eating the same food source?” asks Griffiths. “Or are some of them kind of getting nutrients from each other? Or are there more mobile animals around somehow providing food for this community?” These are all questions only another expedition can answer.  It does appear that sedimentation around the rock isn’t very heavy, meaning the animals aren’t in danger of being buried. “It’s kind of a Goldilocks-type thing going on,” says Griffiths of the rock’s apparently fortuitous location, “where it’s got just enough food coming in, and it’s got nothing that wants to eat them—as far as we can tell—and it’s not getting buried by too much sediment.” (In the sediment surrounding the rock, the researchers also noticed ripples that are typically formed by currents, thus bolstering the theory that food is being carried here from afar.) It’s also not clear how these stationary animals got there in the first place. “Was it something very local, where they kind of hopped from local boulder to local boulder?” asks Griffiths. Alternatively, perhaps their parents lived on a rock hundreds of miles away—where the ice shelf ends and more typical marine ecosystems begin—and released their sperm and eggs to travel in the currents. Because Griffiths and his colleagues don’t have specimens, they also can’t say how old these animals are. Antarctic sponges have been known to live for thousands of years, so it’s possible that this is a truly ancient ecosystem. Perhaps the rock was seeded with life long ago, but currents have also refreshed it with additional life over the millennia. The researchers also can’t say whether this rock is an aberration, or if such ecosystems are actually common under the ice. Maybe the geologists didn’t just get extremely lucky when they dropped their camera onto the rock—maybe these animal communities are a regular feature of the seafloor beneath Antarctica’s ice shelves. There’d certainly be a lot of room for such ecosystems: These floating ice shelves stretch for 560,000 square miles. Yet, through previous boreholes, scientists have only explored an area underneath them equal to the size of a tennis court. So it may well be that they’re out there in numbers, and we just haven’t found them yet. And we may be running out of time to do so. This rock may be locked away under a half mile of ice, but that ice is increasingly imperiled on a warming planet. “There is a potential that some of these big ice shelves in the future could collapse,” says Griffiths, “and we could lose a unique ecosystem.”",Antarctic Stunner: Mysterious Creatures Discovered Under a Half Mile of Ice
261,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/02/biden-declares-major-disaster-in-texas/,MJ,Far Left,"Evan Vucci/AP President Joe Biden has declared a major disaster in Texas after a severe winter storm caused the power grid to fail, leaving millions in the dark and without access to potable water. The move provides federal funding to those affected by the storm. As of Saturday, thousands were still without power and millions more without water or under boil notices. Now that federal aid is available, individuals and business owners can apply for federal emergency aid for home repairs or temporary housing. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has already been in Texas and surrounding states providing food, supplies, water, and generators.  Experts say that Texas’ power grid failed in the storm because officials failed to prepare for climate change, which can cause the type of extreme weather the South saw last week. “The extreme weather events that we’re experiencing this week…do yet again demonstrate to us that climate change is real and it’s happening now,” Liz Sherwood-Randall, a White House adviser, told reporters this week. “And we’re not adequately prepared for it.”",Biden Declares Major Disaster In Texas
262,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/02/texas-is-finally-starting-to-thaw-millions-still-dont-have-water/,MJ,Far Left,"Eric Gay/AP Days after a historic winter storm in Texas brought snow, ice, below-freezing temperatures, and a catastrophic power grid failure, the state is finally starting to thaw—but millions of people still don’t have access to water. At the peak of the storm, more than 4 million people across Texas were in the dark. The state’s independent power grid, not designed to withstand freezing temperatures, failed as demand far outstripped supply. Though Texas officials were warned in 2011 that this very scenario could occur, they still failed to prepare for the disaster. Now, the power has come back for the vast majority of Texans, but their problems are just beginning. Approximately 14.9 million people don’t have water in their homes. When temperatures plummeted, Texas officials told residents to let their faucets drip to prevent pipes from freezing. Then, when the water supply began to run low, officials reversed course and told people to turn off their water, causing pipes to freeze and burst.  In Houston, the fire department said it received 5,000 phone calls about broken pipes. In San Antonio, a city of 1.5 million people, 20 percent of residents don’t have water and 30 percent are facing low pressure issues. On Friday, every household in Austin either had low pressure or no water at all. The implications of going without water are always dire but more so in a pandemic. Not only do Texans not have any water to drink, they will also struggle to wash their hands, a key way to protect yourself from the virus. Across the state, firefighters struggled to find water to put out blazes and thousands of homes have burned.  Viral videos on social media have depicted a state contending with frozen home appliances, burst pipes flooding houses, and burning homes as Texas struggles to regain a sense of normalcy. Officials are warning it could be days before they can full count the dead, but there have been reports of children and seniors dying of hypothermia. As food and water lines stretch around city blocks, state officials have said it could be days before the water supply returns to normal. ",Texas Is Finally Starting to Thaw. Millions Still Don’t Have Water.
263,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/02/were-doing-disaster-planning-all-wrong/,MJ,Far Left,"People wait in line to fill propane tanks in Houston after widespread blackouts.David J. Phillip, AP One of the many reasons millions of Texans were stranded without power in freezing temperatures this week was a fairly common, but faulty, assumption that the future will look a lot like the past. Even without climate change, this approach doesn’t work, because there is always the small chance of a worst-case scenario. But with climate change, betting on a future that resembles what we’re used to is downright irresponsible. The United States, generally, does a poor job planning for the extremes, especially as those extremes become more likely because of climate change. This was certainly a factor in Texas, even if scientists are still hammering out the effect climate change has on unusually bad wintry weather. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the nonprofit that operates Texas’ independent power grid system, did not see a deep freeze of this scale coming, using the average of past winters as a benchmark. Umair Irfan at Vox highlighted a quote from an ERCOT report forecasting winter energy demand and supply in Texas: “We studied a range of potential risks under both normal and extreme conditions, and believe there is sufficient generation to adequately serve our customers.” However, as demand for electricity went soaring, more than 30,000 megawatts of power went offline, already twice the level ERCOT planned for in its most extreme scenario planning.  It is possible to plan better, as Jesse Jenkins, a grid expert at Princeton University, wrote in a New York Times op-ed this week. Jenkins highlighted the preparations Texas could have taken: Pipelines can be buried deeper to insulate against the ground’s cold surface. When gas supplies are disrupted, dual fuel power plants can switch from gas to petroleum stored on site. Wind turbines can be equipped with heaters to keep blades free of ice. Sensors, valves and coolant intakes can be protected against freezing. Long-distance power lines can connect to other regions’ power systems and draw from their supplies during times of need. All of this is possible but costly. Jenkins argued, “We have to use foresight, not hindsight, to identify the kinds of crises that we wish to protect against.”  While Texas is unique for its independent, in-state power grid, which puts it at a disadvantage in handling extremes because it has fewer options to turn to when plants are taken offline, the state is not unique in using hindsight as its guide to prepare for future crises.  The federal government plans its budget for wildfire seasons using a rolling average of the past 10-years of wildfires. With wildfires more likely to spark and burn more widely with drier conditions and soaring temperatures out west, this approach fails to take into account climate projections, and the result is cutting into the rest of the Forest Service’s budget. As a 2015 report from the Department of Agriculture on the rising costs of wildfire suppression detailed: Wildland fire suppression activities are currently funded entirely within the U.S. Forest Service budget, based on a 10-year rolling average. Using this model, the agency must average firefighting costs from the past 10 years to predict and request costs for the next year. When the average was stable, the agency was able to use this model to budget consistently for the annual costs associated with wildland fire suppression. Over the last few decades, however, wildland fire suppression costs have increased as fire seasons have grown longer and the frequency, size, and severity of wildland fires has increased. The National Flood Insurance program uses similarly bad logic, basing rates on outdated definitions for floodplains on the likelihood of 100-year floods, ignoring that these definitions no longer hold up as flooding becomes an annual threat. Joe Scata, a climate attorney at Natural Resources Defense Council, explained last month how FEMA has not comprehensively updated its standards for building and land-use in flood-prone areas since the 1970s. And while Congress mandates FEMA include projections of sea level rise when it does update its flood maps, Scata writes, “FEMA has not included future conditions on any of the 8,000 maps the agency has updated since Congress imposed its mandate. That means communities are making development decisions based on the climate of the past, not the future.” Texas is not helped by the denial that runs deep in its elected officials. But it’s clearly not just a Texas problem. The federal government, states, and cities still have a lot of work to do to recognize that the future threats will not look anything like what we’ve seen before.",We’re Doing Disaster Planning All Wrong

The Biden administration says it has begun reaching out to elected officials, Native American tribes and other stakeholders as part of its review of the Trump administration’s controversial rollback of national monuments, kick-starting a process that is widely expected to result in President Joe Biden fulfilling a campaign promise to restore the protected sites. As part of a sweeping first-day executive order to “protect public health and the environment and restore science,” Biden ordered the Interior Department to review President Donald Trump’s proclamations to dismantle three protected monuments, two in southern Utah and one off the Atlantic coast. Biden has slammed the monument cuts as among Trump’s “assaults on America’s natural treasures.” In 2017, the Trump administration launched a review of recent national monument designations made under the Antiquities Act of 1906. That process featured administration officials cozying up to monument opponents, cherry-picking data and dismissing overwhelming public support for maintaining protected sites, and ended with Trump carving more than 2 million acres away from two sites in southern Utah. The boundary of Bears Ears, a 1.35 million-acre landscape that several tribes consider sacred, was cut by 85 percent. Nearby, Grand Staircase-Escalante, a sweeping 1.87-million-acre monument rich in dinosaur fossils and archeological sites, was cut roughly in half. Later, in June 2020, Trump opened the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, a 4,900-square-mile protected site off the East Coast, to commercial fishing. Now, in a swing of the political pendulum, the Biden administration is reviewing the Trump-era changes. The Interior Department said Tuesday that discussions with stakeholders, including elected officials, tribal nations and the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, would begin shortly and will help the administration determine whether the monument boundaries and protections should be restored. Biden’s executive order gave the Interior Department 60 days to submit a report with its findings and recommendations.

November 16, 2020. Ronen Tivony/SOPA/ZUMA This story was originally published by The Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. BlackRock, the world’s biggest investor, has said that oil companies and other polluting industries should disclose their carbon emissions and set targets to cut them, in the latest sign of the rapid reassessment of climate risks by asset managers. All companies in which BlackRock invests will be expected to disclose direct emissions from operations and from energy they buy, known respectively as scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, the investment firm said in a letter outlining its plans. Fossil fuel extractors should base targets to cut emissions on the carbon released when their products are burned, known as scope 3 emissions, BlackRock said. BlackRock is one of the most influential investors in the world because of its vast actively managed and index-linked funds. The shares, bonds and other assets it controls were worth $8.7 trillion at the end of December, including holdings of billions of dollars in oil companies. Most major listed oil companies have already announced plans to disclose their carbon emissions, and reduce them in line with the target to reach net zero carbon by 2050 set by many governments across the world. BP plans to cut its carbon emissions to virtually zero by 2050, in part by offsetting emissions through carbon capture schemes and natural restoration. It has also promised to grow low-carbon investments eightfold by 2025, and tenfold by 2030, while cutting its fossil fuel output by 40 percent in the next decade. French oil firm Total has made several multibillion pound investments in renewable energy, and has one of the largest pipelines of clean energy projects of any major oil company. Shell has been criticized for putting forward climate plans which are vague, and rely on “carbon intensity” targets in the near-term rather than outright emissions figures. It plans to reach net zero in absolute terms by 2050. US oil company Exxon, considered a climate laggard, has committed to disclosing its emissions and has set near-term targets for reducing emissions, methane and gas flaring. Like Shell, the targets are based on carbon intensity rather than absolute emissions. BlackRock has long been a focus for criticism from activists who argued that it was not fulfilling its responsibilities. But in the last year it has started to vote against companies on climate grounds, in an abrupt turnaround. In 2020 it voted against management at 69 carbon-intensive companies, including on the re-election of 64 directors. BlackRock said last month it would target net zero carbon emissions in its portfolio by 2050, and that it would eventually consider divestment from the polluters who did not take action. Companies should set rigorous short, medium and long-term targets, BlackRock said. It highlighted the UN-backed science-based targets initiative as the leading example of an audited and reliable emissions reductions program. Science-based targets are set to align companies with the aims of the 2015 Paris agreement of limiting global temperature rises to below 2 degrees C. Activists welcomed the extra detail in BlackRock’s policy, but said it should insist on more specific reductions to ensure polluters move more rapidly. Wolfgang Kuhn, director of financial sector strategies at ShareAction, a campaign group, said: “These asks are totally necessary, and it is high time they were included in company engagement on a consistent basis. The issue is that they are in no way sufficient to get us out of the hole; the targets need to be ambitious, and companies need to explain how they are going about reducing their emissions. “Without concrete steps to reduce emissions, action for net zero doesn’t amount to much more than a bit of reporting on the side.”",World’s Biggest Investor Asks Oil Giants to Reveal Their Carbon Emissions
266,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/02/ethanol-emissions-joe-biden-biofuels/,MJ,Far Left,"Kotyński President Joe Biden campaigned on an ambitious plan to tackle climate change with a “clean energy revolution,” including incentives to phase out gas-powered cars in favor of electric ones. The growing consensus among climate experts is that to slash carbon emissions quickly enough, we need to eliminate as much air-fouling combustion as possible while expanding wind and solar energy to power the grid. But a key aspect of Biden’s agenda contradicts this push: He’s vowed to “promote ethanol and the next generation of biofuels,” declaring them “vital to the future of rural America—and the climate.” Biden tapped longtime ethanol champion Tom Vilsack—former governor of Iowa, the fuel’s Saudi Arabia—to run the Department of Agriculture, a post he held under Obama. In doing so, Biden is doubling down on a bad idea that has flourished since the days of President George W. Bush. Shortly before declaring the nation “addicted to oil” in 2006, Bush pushed through a bipartisan law with a “renewable fuel standard” that effectively mandated a dramatic ramp-up in corn ethanol production. As a result, the portion of the massive US corn crop devoted to the fuel rose from 11 percent in 2004 to 30 percent in 2015, where it has held steady. Barack Obama and Donald Trump both joined the pro-ethanol presidential chorus.  Today, corn-based ethanol has replaced about 10 percent of “climate change causing petroleum” at the gas station, boasts the website of the American Coalition for Ethanol, the industry’s main lobbying group, adding that ethanol production “supports 360,000 jobs in rural communities.”  Even though it was once embraced by some environmentalists, ethanol has turned out to be much better at providing common ground for wildly disparate presidents than cutting greenhouse gas emissions. For starters, corn does a lousy job of turning the sun into fuel. Plants store just 1 percent of the solar energy they receive via photosynthesis, notes Mark Jacobson, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford. A solar panel, by contrast, is 20 percent efficient. “So you put a solar panel over the same land, you get 20 times more energy,” Jacobson says—energy that could go toward a grid to power electric cars. But Bush’s federal ethanol mandate tied us to internal combustion engines, which spew a range of disease-causing toxins along with heat-trapping carbon dioxide. Electric engines not only avoid tailgate fumes, they’re also much more efficient. According to the Department of Energy, conventional vehicles convert at most 30 percent of the energy stored in liquid fuel to horsepower; the rest leaks out, mostly as heat. Electric-powered vehicles, meanwhile, convert at least 60 percent of energy expended to locomotion. Meanwhile, EV battery technology is improving rapidly, meaning cheaper electric cars with longer ranges between plug-ins—solving two problems that have held back electric car sales for years. From 2010 to 2020, battery prices plunged 89 percent. By 2023, according to a projection by Car and Driver, electric vehicles will be no more expensive than their fuel-burning competitors. In short, maintaining ethanol production at current levels means propping up a wildly energy-wasting technology. For that to make sense as climate policy—the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that we need to cut global carbon emissions by 45 percent by 2030 to avert catastrophe—ethanol would have to be magical stuff indeed. Spoiler: It’s not. From a greenhouse gas emissions perspective, the renewable fuel standard has been a bust, says Jason Hill, a professor at the University of Minnesota’s Department of Bioproducts and Biosystems Engineering. By displacing petroleum, the ethanol mandate made conventional gasoline cheaper, which made people drive more while buying less-fuel-efficient vehicles. As a result, Hill and two colleagues found in a 2016 paper, the net effect of the law was to increase greenhouse gas emissions from cars by about 22 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, equivalent to the output of nearly six coal-fired power plants. The environmental footprint of industrial-scale corn farming is another stain on ethanol’s claim to be a green fuel. Corn typically covers about 90 million acres of farmland—an area nearly the size of California. Fertilizing the crop emits nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon,  as well as nitrate pollution that fouls water from the upper Midwest to the Gulf of Mexico, where it generates a low-oxygen dead zone larger than Connecticut. Hill and his colleagues have found that nitrogen fertilizer applied to corn also results in emissions of ammonia, a powerful pollutant, that have been associated with a staggering 4,300 premature deaths yearly in the United States. But what about the 360,000 jobs in rural communities supposedly supported by the ethanol industry? According to David Swenson, a researcher at Iowa State University’s Department of Economics, that’s more industry spin. To reach that number, ethanol boosters include a portion of all corn farmers and their employees in their calculations. But corn was a wildly overproduced crop when ethanol took off in the early 2000s. The ethanol boom mostly created a market for surplus corn, not new jobs. Swenson estimates the ethanol industry is directly responsible for only about 47,000 jobs, a tiny fraction of rural employment, even in corn-heavy states like Iowa. Meanwhile, the Energy Department reported in 2017 that solar energy alone employs more Americans than oil, coal, and gas combined. With the rise of cheap electric car batteries and the expansion of renewable electricity, ethanol looks like yesterday’s fuel. In 2022, the current renewable fuel standard will lapse, and Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency will have to decide whether to maintain federal support for this hangover of the oil-soaked Bush era.",Why Won’t Joe Biden Let Ethanol Die Already?
267,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/02/ikeas-ambitious-plan-to-make-its-cheap-furniture-last-forever/,MJ,Far Left,"Illustration: Rebecca Zisser/Huffpost; Photos: Getty, Ikea This article was originally published by HuffPost and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. The Ikea store in Queens, New York, which opened on Jan. 14, marked a decided departure for the iconic home furnishings brand. Located in the Rego Park Shopping Center, the 115,000-square-foot open layout—a new, smaller format for Ikea—is divided into core areas of the home, offering small-space solutions tailored to city living. Rooms are thoughtfully merchandised with easily portable accessories like lamps and throw pillows that customers can take with them on the bus or subway, both of which are a block away—a key factor in choosing the store’s location, given that more than half of city residents use public transportation. Digital stations allow shoppers to self-pay and arrange furniture delivery for bigger pieces for a flat fee of $49. The company is working to make all last-mile deliveries in New York City by electric vehicle, according to Jennifer Keesson, country sustainability manager for Ikea U.S.—a test run on the way to making the last mile of its more than 2 million annual home deliveries nationwide zero emissions by 2025.  Ikea’s overarching goal is to become “climate positive” by 2030—reducing more greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) than its entire value chain emits. It plans to do this while still growing its business by designing new products, moving into new markets and building dozens, perhaps hundreds, of new stores in that time. The company is charging ahead with plans to open 50 more stores (of various sizes and formats) in 2021 alone.The Swedish powerhouse set out 80 years ago “to create a better everyday life for the many people”—as its motto goes—by putting sleek, stylish home furnishings within the budgets of the masses, and became a $35.4 billion (2020 revenues) market force in the process. And just as the brand is widely credited with democratizing design, it’s now moving to make sustainable living the norm rather than the exception, with a sprawling strategy that’s wildly ambitious in scope. Expanding its retail footprint on a warming planet may seem to fly directly in the face of Ikea’s plan to reduce its colossal climate footprint. In the last year, moves to decrease energy use across the business, from manufacturing to what it serves in its restaurants, have reduced its climate footprint per product sold by 7%, the company estimates. Meeting its 2030 target while selling ever more will mean cutting the average climate footprint per product by 70%. Given that Ikea emitted the equivalent of 24.9 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2019—accounting for 0.1% of the world’s GHG emissions that year—it’s a Herculean undertaking that encompasses virtually every element of its business, from the materials it sources through product manufacturing and transport. Emissions reductions will also come from efforts to pull carbon out of the atmosphere (without the use of carbon offsets) and influence supplier and customer behavior.  Making products last longer, and giving old products second lives, is a central pillar of its climate ambitions: Ikea aims to become a “100% circular business” by 2030. That means creating home goods that not only meet Ikea’s definition of “democratic design”—affordable, high-quality, sustainable, stylish and functional—but also can be reused, refurbished, recycled or remanufactured into new items. Materials contribute the most to Ikea’s overall climate footprint, followed by the use of products in customer homes. Squeezing carbon savings out of those budgets poses the greatest hurdles toward meeting its ambitious targets, which were set to align with the Paris climate accord goal of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.  “An increasing number of companies have said they’ll be climate positive by 2040 or 2050, but relatively few have said 2030,” said Andrew Winston, a corporate sustainability strategist and author of “The Big Pivot.” “Ikea’s challenge is also much more complicated because they manufacture tons of different products—unlike a company like Google, which has also set incredibly aggressive goals.” The sprawling infrastructure and commercial leverage that enables the company to manufacture and sell millions of products is exactly what Ikea is banking on to realize its climate goals. “Obviously the consumption model of the 1900s that we were part of will not work in the future, because we’re consuming more than the planet can provide,” said Ingka Group CEO Jesper Brodin on a Harvard Business Review podcast last December. Ingka Group is the largest of 12 strategic partners in Ikea’s franchise system, operating 380 Ikea stores around the world. “I love mass production,” said Brodin, “because if you put it in the right aspect, you can scale up change so much better and faster. If you can scale something that’s climate-positive, that’s probably the best and fastest way of doing it—and bring the cost down so sustainability doesn’t become something that’s only for those who can afford it.” Arguably few companies, particularly in the retail industry, have Ikea’s vision and knack for innovation. Founded in 1943 by the late Ingvar Kamprad—the name is an acronym of his initials, his family farm (Elmtaryd), and his birthplace (Agunnaryd)—it quickly became known for low prices. Chagrined competitors tried to pressure suppliers to boycott the brand, driving Kamprad to start designing products in-house and thinking early about moving beyond his home market. Ikea shifted to flat-pack, self-assembly products in 1953 to minimize shipping costs and damage to mail-order deliveries. In 1970, the first self-service area was opened at Ikea’s flagship store near Stockholm, which allowed customers to walk out with flat-pack furniture in hand to assemble at home. The debut of Ikea’s first store outside of Scandinavia, in Switzerland, in 1973 set the stage for international expansion: Ikea is now the world’s largest home furnishings business, with nearly 530 stores (including test formats and planning studios) in more than 50 countries. The seeds of Ikea’s shift to sustainability were planted (literally) in 1998, with the launch of the “Sow a Seed” Foundation, which sought to rehabilitate large swaths of rainforest lost to logging and forest fires in Malaysian Borneo. Over the next two decades, Ikea funded the replanting of 3 million trees across 31,000 now-protected acres of rainforest.  Sustainable forestry has long been a key focus of the brand, for good reason. Ikea uses wood in 60% of its products. Last year, it used just under 671 million cubic feet of wood (enough to fill 18 Empire State Buildings) in home furnishings and packaging, most of it from Poland, Russia, Belarus, Sweden and Germany. About 12% of it was recycled and nearly all the rest was certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, a nonprofit group that promotes responsible forestry (Ikea is a founding member), meaning its harvesting did not contribute to deforestation. Ikea still runs into criticism from time to time. Last year, the company was accused of illegally sourcing wood from Ukraine; a third-party independent investigation found no evidence of such timber in its supply chain, attributing the allegations to ambiguity surrounding the law concerning certain forest management practices. FSC is now working to resolve the issue. Wood as a resource is under threat from deforestation, wildfires, pests and other climate change impacts. The brand’s commitment to sustainable forest management is intended to ensure that its most critical raw material remains in sufficient supply. It also aims to enhance biodiversity, support those whose livelihoods are forest-dependent and protect vital carbon-sequestering trees. A big chunk of the company’s emissions reductions rely on keeping carbon locked up in the plants and soils of healthy forests. To that end, Ikea invests heavily in forestland, where the company can reap carefully managed timber. Earlier this month, Ingka Group announced its acquisition of nearly 11,000 forested acres in southeast Georgia from The Conservation Fund, assuming its legally binding obligations to protect the land from fragmentation, restore trees and protect wildlife. The company now owns 136,000 acres of forest across five states, and some 613,000 acres combined in the U.S. and Europe. “Seventy percent of our footprint comes from materials,” said Pia Heidenmark Cook, Ingka Group’s chief sustainability officer. “So the products we put on the market, the materials we choose and where we source them from are critical.” Ikea is taking a close look at its entire supply chain, said Cook, with the goal of using only recycled or renewable materials (like sustainably sourced wood and cotton) in its over 9,500 products by 2030. Today 10% of products contain recycled material, such as plastic and polyester, and 60% contain renewable materials. The company has so far mapped out how to achieve half its materials footprint reduction goals for 2030 and has to figure out how to get the rest of the way there. In the December podcast, Brodin called raw materials the most challenging part of the sustainability equation, noting that materials R&D has been one of the brand’s top investment priorities for nearly a decade. “In terms of material innovation, the majority of investment is connected to our sustainability agenda—to find new materials that have a smaller climate or water footprint than what we use today,” said Cook. Laminated veneer lumber (LVL) is one material showing promise. A relatively new engineered product, it comprises multiple thin layers of wood glued together and cuts down on wood consumption by up to 40%. Its strength is comparable to metal in some applications, making it a potentially viable substitute for steel and aluminum, which have a high climate footprint due to their energy-intensive production process. Another project explores using rice straw—a harvesting residue that’s typically burned and contributes to air pollution in places like northern India—as a new renewable material source. Ikea has also partnered with clothing retailer H&M and forest products manufacturer Stora Enso to invest in Tree To Textile, a company that transforms wood cellulose into a sustainable textile fiber that could potentially serve as an alternative to cotton, Ikea’s second-most-used raw material behind wood. Last year, the brand used nearly 142,000 tons of the water-intensive crop—0.5% of cotton production worldwide. So far, alternative materials are still in testing phases or limited use. Ikea’s rice-straw product prototypes debuted as the FÖRÄNDRING (“change” in Swedish) collection of rugs, bowls and baskets at stores in India last year, with limited volumes in a few European markets. Should the company determine these new materials are viable, it will take years to update designs, adapt supply chains and bring production to scale. But the advantage of Ikea’s size and clout means that if the company does identify any breakthrough renewable materials, it could push suppliers to get on board. “Ikea is fairly unique in its ability to tell a potential supplier, ‘If you can’t meet our terms, we’ll find someone else who will,'” said Tom Eggert, a senior lecturer on business sustainability at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “Whether it’s a wood alternative or plant-based plastics or something else entirely, they have the buying power to create a market where one may not yet exist.” While cheap sofas and tables are the company’s bread and butter, the brand is one of the world’s largest food sellers: 680 million customers visited its food outlets in 2019. It sells a billion of its signature Swedish meatballs a year. But meat is an ecological nightmare—livestock production accounts for more than 14% of total global greenhouse emissions and is a leading cause of deforestation. So Ikea is retooling its menu. The company has sold over 5 million veggie hot dogs since unveiling them in 2018. Last August, it introduced the HUVUDROLL plant ball, an alternative to its iconic meatball. With ingredients like pea protein and potatoes, it mimics meat’s taste and texture (unlike the brand’s veggie balls, which debuted in 2015), with a climate footprint that’s only 4% of the beef-and-pork original. The company aims to make 50% of its restaurant entrees plant-based by 2025, and 80% of them non-red meat (of animals raised for food, cows and pigs are the biggest GHG contributors). The brand’s packaged food will also be 80% plant-based within five years. Ikea’s other not-so-small side hustle is helping eliminate fossil fuels from its retail operations and production: The company is striving for 100% renewable energy across its entire value chain by 2030—including helping secure 100% renewable electricity for its nearly 1,600 suppliers. Ikea has been investing in solutions like solar and wind farms around the world since 2009. Its clean energy portfolio now includes 547 wind turbines and two solar farms in 14 countries, and more than 920,000 solar panels on the roofs of Ikea stores and warehouses. Last year, for the first time, Ingka Group generated more renewable energy—by a third—than it consumed globally in retail and distribution operations. “Ikea is very much ahead of the curve in retail,” said Winston. “They were one of the biggest renewable energy purchasers before the big tech companies started their buying sprees.” In order to realize its vision of becoming 100% circular by 2030—eliminating waste by keeping materials and finished products in use—Ikea must not only make products out of recycled and recyclable materials, but also convince its hundreds of millions of customers to recycle or reuse them. “A truly circular economy approach is going to have to deal with end of life of products in a totally revolutionary way compared with their current business model,” said ecological economist Tim Jackson, author of the upcoming book “Post Growth: Life After Capitalism.” The company is exploring how to entice customers to do their part. During its #BuyBackFriday campaign late last year—conceived as an alternative to traditional Black Friday marketing blitzes—Ikea stores in 27 countries offered to buy back and resell thousands of used home furnishings. Customers received vouchers worth between 30% and 50% of their item’s original price, depending on its condition. (Anything that couldn’t be resold was recycled or donated to COVID-19 community outreach projects.) Down the road, as the company develops its methods, a bought-back chair could be stripped to its frame, polished, painted, and reshaped into a new chair. Ikea is turning their “as-is” sections—where last year, 30.5 million discontinued and seasonal items, floor samples and customer returns were sold at discounted prices—into “circular hubs.” Customers can bargain hunt for secondhand furnishings while picking up tips on fixing, cleaning or hacking their Ikea products. There are plans to launch hubs in half of Ikea’s stores by the end of the year. Ikea’s first entirely secondhand store, a six-month test project, debuted in Eskilstuna, Sweden, last November. “The perception of Ikea as a mass producer of stuff that doesn’t last very long has probably been its biggest Achilles’ heel,” Winston said. “This relatively new effort to change the lifecycle of their products by refurbishing, reselling, or entirely recycling them is probably one of the most important things that they’re doing.” Jackson put a fine point on it: “#BuyBackFriday was a symbolic gesture. It needs to be an everyday reality.” Cook says Ikea’s challenge “is to make sustainable living mainstream.” The company has had some past success. Back in 2015, when the most popular alternatives to inefficient incandescent light bulbs were halogens and compact fluorescent lamps, Ikea switched all its lighting products to light-emitting diodes (LEDs), believing that it could build an economy of scale and make LEDs a commercial success. The bulbs sold for about $7 at the time; they now cost less than $1 each and Ikea sold 56 million of them in 2019. “In general, we are always trying to support the education of our customers [on] how to live a more sustainable and a healthier life at home,” Keesson said. It’s reasonable to question how any company with a business model based on selling more and more stuff can expand in a truly sustainable way. Some argue that with a burgeoning global middle class on the rise and eager to spend their disposable income, we need companies that will make the effort to stay within the limits of what the planet can provide. “Demand will continue to grow as more and more people emerge from extreme poverty, and others move from poverty into the middle class,” Eggert said. “They’re going to want the same things the rest of the world has—affordable tables, chairs, all the things that Ikea sells. And Ikea says it’s going to meet that demand as sustainably as possible. Isn’t that better than some of the other alternatives out there?” This story was amended to correct a typographical error in the size of Ikea’s store in Queens.",Inside Ikea’s Ambitious Plan to Make Cheap Furniture Last Forever
268,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/02/these-scientists-are-literally-allergic-to-their-research/,MJ,Far Left,"When he could no longer bear working with snakes, Bryan Fry switched to studying animals like the slow loris. Dedy Istanto/Xinhua via ZUMA Press This story was originally published by Undark and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. Bryan Fry’s heart was pounding as he stepped back from the snake enclosure and examined the bite marks on his hand. He had just been bitten by a death adder, one of Australia’s most venomous snakes. Its neurotoxin-laced bite could cause vomiting, paralysis and—as the name suggests—death. Fry, at the time a graduate student, had kept snakes for years. Oddly, the neurotoxins weren’t his biggest worry; the nearby hospital would have the antivenom he needed, and, although data is limited, people who receive treatment generally survive. Anaphylactic shock, on the other hand, might kill him within minutes. “Anaphylactic shock is the single worst feeling you can possibly imagine,” recalled Fry, now a biologist at the University of Queensland in Australia. “It is just insane. Every cell in your body is screaming out in mortal terror.” Fry, who had spent his life admiring and eventually studying venomous snakes, had become deathly allergic to them. While most cases are not so extreme, anecdotal reports and expert analysis suggest that it is far from rare for scientists, students, and laboratory technicians to develop allergies to the organisms they study. Perversely, some allergy researchers say, it is the researchers’ passion for their subjects—the close observation, the long hours of work each day, and the years of commitment to a research project—that puts them at such high risk. “It is true that some things cause allergies more often than others, but the biggest factor is the frequency of the interaction with the study organism,” said John Carlson, a physician and researcher at Tulane University who specializes in insect and dust mite allergies. “You probably have about a 30 percent chance of developing an allergy to whatever it is that you study.” While data is limited, that estimate is in line with research on occupational allergies, which studies suggest occur in as many as 44 percent of people who work with laboratory rodents, around 40 percent of veterinarians, and 25 to 60 percent of people who work with insects. Federal guidelines suggest that laboratories have “well-designed air-handling systems” and that workers don appropriate personal protective equipment, or PPE, in order to reduce the risk of developing an allergy. However, interviews with researchers and experts suggest that there may be little awareness of—or adherence to—guidelines like these. For scientists working with less-common species and those engaged in fieldwork, information on what exactly constitutes appropriate PPE may be very limited. Many researchers, perhaps especially those who do fieldwork, are used to being uncomfortable in service of their work, Carlson points out. “I think that a lot of researchers are so interested in the process of the research,” he said, “that they aren’t really considering the long-term effects that it could have on them.” In general, allergies develop when the immune system overreacts to a substance that is usually harmless, or relatively harmless. The immune system monitors the body for potentially dangerous invaders like bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Sometimes, for reasons that are not well understood, the immune system identifies something benign, like pollen or animal dander, as dangerous. To help mark the intruder, a person who has become sensitized in this way produces antibodies, or types of proteins, to identify it. When that person comes into contact with the substance again, the antibodies flag it as an invader. As part of the response, immune cells release compounds like histamine, which irritate and inflame the surrounding tissues, resulting in allergy symptoms. Although some risk factors have been identified, researchers who study allergies are often unable to determine exactly why this overreaction occurs in some people but not others. But it’s clear that, for some substances, repeated exposures can increase the likelihood of an allergic response. While anecdotes of allergic scientists abound, research into the issue is scant. The best documented are allergies to rodents, which are ubiquitous in biomedical research. But some scientists report allergies that are almost completely unstudied, potentially because relatively few people—at least in wealthy nations in which many allergy studies are conducted—regularly come into contact with the organisms that cause them. For example, while most people avoid regular contact with leeches, University of Toronto doctoral student Danielle de Carle goes out looking for them. De Carle studies leech genetics in order to figure out how different species are related to one another and to understand how blood feeding evolved. To study the leeches, she first has to catch them, and like other researchers in her field, she uses her own body as bait. “We wade into swamps and stuff, and we let them attach to us and feed from us,” she said. For most people, leech bites are relatively painless. When de Carle needed to keep the leeches alive in the lab, she would let them feed on her then as well. After about a year and a half of this, she started to notice symptoms. At first, the bites became itchy, but the more she was exposed, the worse it got. “The last time I fed a leech—which I try not to do anymore—my entire hand swelled up so much that I could hardly make a fist,” she said. “It itched like crazy.” De Carle said that, when she’s out hunting leeches now, she can avoid an allergic reaction if she removes the leech after it attaches itself to her, but before it starts to feed. For the leeches she keeps in the lab, she’s switched to feeding them pig’s blood from a butcher shop instead of letting them feed on her. Nia Walker, a Ph.D. student in biology at Stanford University, has also begun reacting to her research organism. Walker studies how genetics influence coral bleaching resistance and recovery. She began to notice rashes on her hands during her third trip to conduct fieldwork on corals in Palau, an island nation in the South Pacific. “And then each subsequent trip after that, it got more and more extreme,” she said. “It got to the point where my face would bloat and I’d get welts on my hands from touching them.” While her symptoms are especially intense, Walker said she’s not the only member of her lab who has developed a sensitivity. By now, she said, everyone in the lab has “developed a slight irritation to corals.” Walker has been able to manage her allergy by using protective equipment and over-the-counter antihistamines. “It’s sad,” she said, “but it’s also pretty funny.” Likewise, Brechann McGoey, who received her doctorate in ecology and evolutionary biology from the University of Toronto, said she didn’t experience hay fever before she started her graduate work. But after repeated exposure to ragweed pollen during experiments, she developed symptoms like post-nasal drip and persistent cough. Even though she no longer works with the species, she still gets hay fever every fall during ragweed season. “It’s a souvenir from my Ph.D.,” she joked.Sometimes, allergies that scientists have picked up during lab work can spill over into daily life. More than a decade ago, evolutionary biologist Karl Grieshop worked in a fruit fly lab in which bananas were a key part of the flies’ diet. Ever since, he said, his throat gets itchy every time he eats a banana. Jon Giddens, a doctoral student in plant biology at the University of Oklahoma, said that he didn’t have any allergies before he started studying Eastern redcedar, a small evergreen tree that is widespread in some regions of the country. But now, even though it’s been more than a year since he last worked with the species in the field, he has year-round nasal allergy symptoms, he thinks from the redcedar pollen in the air. Reflecting previous research on occupational allergies in veterinarians, most of the researchers who spoke with Undark did not seek medical attention or get a formal diagnosis for their allergies. In many cases, scientists report that their allergies are annoying but manageable. But sometimes, the allergies force researchers to make major changes. Entomologist Chip Taylor began his career studying sulphur butterflies as a Ph.D. student at the University of Connecticut. When he started his own lab at the University of Kansas in 1969, he had every intention of continuing to work with the species. But, he said, “by the time it rolled around to 1973, I realized I was so allergic to these butterflies.” Taylor began to experience asthma-like symptoms whenever he worked with them. In the summer of that year, during a research trip to central Arizona, Taylor and a colleague rented a trailer to use as a workstation to process butterfly wing samples. “I could not go in the trailer,” he recalled. “I slept outside with my back up against a tree so my sinuses and my throat could drain.” To manage his symptoms, he was regularly taking prednisone, a powerful anti-inflammatory drug that can have serious side effects. “I decided that I had to get out of working with those butterflies,” Taylor said. “I had to readjust my career to work on something else.” Taylor spent the next few decades studying killer bees. He returned to butterfly research in 1992, when he started the monarch butterfly conservation program Monarch Watch. Taylor said he’s never experienced any symptoms while working with monarchs—maybe, he guesses, because the two species produce different types of pigments. Fry, the biologist who became allergic to snake venom, also said his allergy has shaped his career. The venoms of different snake species share similar components, Fry said, so someone who is allergic to one type of snake is likely allergic to many types. Because of this allergy, Fry also has to be extremely careful even around venomous snakes that are usually not dangerous to humans. “Whenever I work with these animals now, I look like I’m going into the Hurt Locker,” he said, referencing the Oscar-winning movie about U.S. Army specialists who defused bombs in Iraq. “So, of course, in the tropical sun I’m absolutely melting.” Those limitations, he said, have made working with snakes less enjoyable. “I can’t just blithely interact with these animals that I find so absolutely fascinating, knowing that death is just around the corner at any given moment, even from a snake that normally wouldn’t be a medical problem.” Fry survived his encounter with the death adder thanks to a snakebite kit containing injectable adrenaline and antihistamines, as well as a quick-thinking friend who raced him to the hospital. The allergy, he said, has caused him to redirect much of his research to studying venoms in other animals, including Komodo dragons, slow lorises (the world’s only venomous primates), funnel-web spiders, and box jellyfish. “I’ve managed to turn it into a good thing,” he said, “but it’s been nevertheless very frustrating.” Allergy experts say that reducing exposure is the key to preventing allergy development. Exactly how much the exposure needs to be reduced is less clear, and increasing protection may be costly for institutions and inconvenient for researchers. Some laboratories that use mice and rats have equipment and policies designed to reduce exposure to allergens. These labs install ventilation systems for the cages, use a robotic system to clean them out, house fewer animals per room, and provide an area for workers to change out of allergen-contaminated clothing. PPE such as masks, gloves, and gowns can also help researchers reduce their exposure. But actually applying those preventative measures can be challenging, said Johanna Feary, who studies occupational lung disease as a senior clinical research fellow at Imperial College London. In 2019, Feary and several colleagues published a study of seven research institutions in the United Kingdom that performed research on mice. They found that facilities that used individually ventilated cages, instead of open cages, had dramatically lower airborne allergen levels. But even that was not sufficient to prevent technicians from becoming sensitized to mouse allergens. The facilities with the lowest levels of sensitization were those where workers also wore properly fitted masks. The research, she said, demonstrated that, at least in the U.K., the development of allergies to lab animals “is probably preventable in almost all cases.” But Feary said that lab animal allergies continue to be a problem for many people. “We should be getting better at it,” she said. “I’m not sure we are getting better at it.” The main reason, according to Feary, is that it can be costly to install equipment that reduces allergen exposure, such as those robotic cage cleaners, especially if it requires renovating older facilities. It’s also hard to accurately assess the magnitude of the problem, she said, especially given that conditions and practices differ widely around the world. While well-run facilities will monitor workers’ exposure and health, “at the other end of the scale, you have filthy places with poor health and safety,” she said, where recordkeeping is patchy and people who develop allergies may simply feel compelled to seek work elsewhere. “So, it may look like everything’s fine, and nobody’s got any symptoms, but actually all the sick people have left,” Feary said. It may also be the case that only the best-run facilities will report their data, she said, while the rest will simply not engage. Indeed, several years ago, when a group of Duke University researchers attempted a nationwide survey of the incidence of anaphylaxis associated with lab-animal bites in the U.S., only 16 percent of facilities even responded. And with less well-studied allergies, there’s simply little information available regarding prevalence and what sorts of protections are sufficient to prevent their development. Several scientists living with allergies, though, said they think that more information and awareness could help increase the number of scientists taking precautions in their research. Fry said there is more awareness of snake venom allergy than there was when he started formally studying snakes in the late 1990s. But, he added, “it’s still not as well-known as it should be.” Researchers in the field, he wrote in a follow-up email, can be reticent to talk about venom allergies. But, he said, “I’m quite candid about it because, you know, this is life-saving information.” Walker, the coral biologist, said more research on allergies among researchers would be helpful. “A lot of these things can be addressed if you knew to look out for it,” she said. Early-career scientists generally receive thorough training on proper handling of biohazards and harmful chemicals. Institutions often provide extensive safety plans for fieldwork to help researchers prepare for the various risks involved, from dehydration to hypothermia to bear attacks. But scientists may learn little about the potential for developing allergies to seemingly harmless organisms. “I feel like maybe there’s a bit too much of a casual attitude about protective gear,” said McGoey, who developed an allergy after doing research on ragweed. “Maybe especially if you’re working with a plant or animal, where it’s like a natural thing, and you’re not in the lab with a chemical, maybe people are just not careful enough.” “As silly as it sounds, just maybe having more emphasis on using PPE and the consequences of not doing it would be kind of nice,” said de Carle, the leech researcher. “It can be really easy to just think, like, ‘Oh, I don’t really need to wear gloves; I’m just touching flowers or whatever.'” Carlson, the allergist, said that even well-informed researchers can get caught up in their enthusiasm for the work and rationalize not taking the proper precautions. In 2009, Carlson worked on a project that involved collecting data on house dust mites, microscopic arthropods which cause nasal and respiratory issues in millions of people worldwide. Despite his expertise, he neglected PPE. “I know all this,” he said. “I know I should be wearing a mask, but it’s hot, and it’s sweaty, and I don’t have a boss telling me what to do.” As he worked, he developed a runny nose and itchy eyes—the first steps toward a full-fledged allergy. “I pushed through and I ended up hyper-sensitizing myself,” Carlson said, to the point that even getting down on the ground to play with his then-young children made him “absolutely miserable.” Carlson is saddened thinking about those scientists who have to give up the work they love due to allergies. “I really do feel for these folks doing their work and developing an allergy,” he said. “The more we get the word out there, the better.” Hannah Thomasy is a freelance science writer splitting time between Toronto and Seattle.

269,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/02/two-tricks-that-may-tame-your-cats-taste-for-furry-feathery-critters/,MJ,Far Left,"David Cliff/ Nur Photo/ ZUMA Feeding pet cats meaty food and playing with them to simulate hunting stops them killing wildlife, according to a new study. Eating grain-free food led to the cats depositing a third fewer mouse and bird corpses on doorsteps, while just five to 10 minutes of play with a toy mouse cut the killing by a quarter. There are 7.5 million cats in the UK and they are estimated to kill about 100 million animals a year. The toll is billions in the US and 230 million in Australia. Mammals such as mice, rats and rabbits make up two-thirds of the UK kills, a quarter are birds such as sparrows and blackbirds, and the rest are frogs and lizards. Concern for wildlife has clashed with the reluctance of cat owners to keep their pets indoors, to inhibit what they see as their natural behavior or to make them wear deterrent devices on collars that may become snagged. The new research is the first to tackle the root causes of why well-fed cats still hunt and the scientists said the results were good for wildlife, cats and their owners. The research found that bells on collars made no difference to the number of animals killed, perhaps because the cats learned to hunt with them. Another measure – puzzle balls filled with dry food that falls out through holes as the cats bat the balls around – was found to increase hunting by a third. These cats may simply have been hungry, the scientists said. “Cats like the thrill of the hunt,” said Prof Robbie McDonald, at the University of Exeter in England. “Previous measures like bells tried to stymie the cat at the last minute. What we did was try to head them off at the pass by addressing some of their needs or wants before they think about going out hunting. Our study shows that with entirely non-invasive, non-restrictive methods, owners can change what the cats themselves want to do.” The scientists are not sure why the killing was reduced by feeding the cats premium food in which all the proteins came from meat, but they said cats had specific dietary needs, including particular amino acids found in meat. “Some cat foods contain protein from plant sources and it is possible these foods leave some cats deficient in one or more micronutrients, prompting them to hunt,” said Martina Cecchetti, at the University of Exeter, who conducted the tests. “However, meat production raises clear climate and environmental issues, so one of our next steps is to find out whether specific micronutrients could be added to cat foods to reduce hunting.” The study, published in the journal Current Biology, followed more than 300 cats before and after their food was changed or playtime was introduced, and also included a control group. Play lasted five to 10 minutes, the average length of a hunt, and involved owners moving a feather toy on a string and wand so cats could stalk, chase and pounce. Owners gave the cats a toy mouse to play with after each simulated hunt, mimicking a real kill. Playing reduced the number of mammal kills but not bird kills. This may be because playtime was often in the evening, close to night-time when cats hunt mice and rats, the scientists said. Bird hunts usually take place in the morning. The meaty food reduced mammal and birds hunts. Another measure, brightly colored collars, cut bird kills by 42% but had no effect on mammal kills, again possibly because the latter hunts take place in darkness. The researchers do not yet know if more playtime would have cut hunting more, or if the effects of giving meaty food and playing would add together, but they aim to do further research. Three-quarters of owners said they would continue playing with their pets after the study ended but only a third said they would stick with the more costly premium food. Lisa George, from Helston, Cornwall, looks after Minnie, a three-year-old tabby who took part in the trial. “Minnie loves to hunt,” she said. “We’ve had birds in the bedroom, rats in the waste paper bin and rabbits in the utility room. On changing her food [from supermarket own-brand], she hardly hunted at all. I couldn’t believe the difference.” George Bradley, from SongBird Survival, a charity that funded the research, said: “The study shows that cat owners – like me – can take a few easy steps to really improve the health and happiness of our pets as well as make a really big difference for all our wildlife.” Bradley said populations of songbirds such as sparrows and willow tits had fallen by half in the UK over the past 50 years. The study only included cats known to hunt. “It is probably a minority of cats that kill,” said McDonald. “But that doesn’t reduce the significance of it, because we’ve got such a large cat population. The cat density in residential areas is so much higher than the natural predator population.”","Two Tricks That Could Tame Your Cat’s Taste for Furry, Feathery Critters"

Rosales/ Albuquerque Journal/ZUMA This story is the final of three installments in a series by High Country News and Arizona Public Media and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. Read part one and part two of the series. Over the last two years, Ron Pulliam, an ecologist from the small southern Arizona town of Patagonia, has watched as the new border wall construction snaked its way along the U.S.-Mexico border. The border wall was a cornerstone of President Donald Trump’s election campaign, and during his term, he built slightly over 450 miles of new wall. Today, over 700 miles of both old and new wall line the nearly 2,000-mile-long border. When Trump left office, one of the projects still under construction involved dynamiting mountainous terrain in the Coronado National Memorial to build access roads to the wall. “That is a really crazy project,” Pulliam said, having recently witnessed the destruction. “(They are) basically tearing down a mountain inside the memorial, in a place where it’s not going to add to border security at all.” Now that Joe Biden is president, border wall construction has been halted, fulfilling one of the Democrat’s own campaign promises. Yet his overarching vision for the Borderlands remains vague. A White House fact sheet about Biden’s new immigration bill called for “smart border controls” that employ technology between ports of entry, which could mean surveillance towers and drones, but it is unclear whether he will remove the wall erected by his predecessor. In the absence of a clear plan, environmentalists like Pulliam and human rights advocates hope to have some influence over what happens next. It’s part of their plan to reimagine the Borderlands: making the area a place of restoration instead of destruction, a place of refuge instead of fear. “Any place where you have edges, where we have boundaries and borders, there’s always conflict,” Pulliam said. “But there’s also a great opportunity to do things you can’t do elsewhere.” Some of the activists’ ideas, like leaving existing corridors open for wildlife migration, are fairly pragmatic, while others are more aspirational. But all require the restoration of a region that has been systematically degraded. One immediate action that over a dozen environmental organizations recommend is the removal of sections of the wall, said Myles Traphagen, a biologist with the nonprofit Wildlands Network—particularly at Arizona’s Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, home to Quitobaquito Springs, and the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge. “These (recommendations) are based upon the presence of threatened and endangered species, of places that impede water flow and wildlife movement and places that have Indigenous cultural significance,” he explained—areas where animals like the Sonoran pronghorn migrate, or where important cultural sites are located. Other measures Biden could take include opening the floodgates already built into the border wall to allow for wildlife migration and keeping the floodlighting system off. “They haven’t turned on the high-intensity lighting,” Traphagen said. “Well, just don’t flip the switch.” If parts of the wall are removed, the damaged landscape will need to be restored. In 2012, Pulliam founded the Borderlands Restoration Network, a nonprofit that undertakes restoration projects to improve wetlands and wildlife habitat. He envisions a federal program like the Depression Era Civilian Conservation Corps, comprising people from both sides of the border who could be paid with what’s left of the $15 billion earmarked for wall construction. “We like to think of it as creating a restoration economy,” said Pulliam. “That’s based on working with the land and water and wildlife in such a way that you actually enhance the conservation of those assets.” Even if Biden begins restoration and wall deconstruction, without legislative changes, the border will remain vulnerable to the political winds of the moment. In 2005, the George W. Bush administration passed the REAL ID Act, which granted a waiver authority for wall construction. That enabled Trump’s Department of Homeland Security to waive numerous environmental laws at the border. Legislation has been introduced to repeal the waiver, but so far it has yet to succeed, said Paulo Lopes, a public-lands policy specialist with the Center for Biological Diversity. “That will be one of our legislative asks,” Lopes said. “To basically restore the laws (at the border) that apply everywhere else in this country.” President Biden could also ask Congress to rescind $1.375 billion in funding for border wall construction that was allocated for the 2021 fiscal year. Vicki Gaubeca, the Tucson-based director of the Southern Border Communities Coalition, wants the new administration to abandon border walls altogether. “A border wall only serves to aggravate a situation,” she said. Instead, we should take a serious look at the root causes of migration—problems like climate change—and determine how we can “surge humanitarian resources at the borders,” she said. For Gaubeca, it’s not just about the wall: Her organization focuses on the impacts of border militarization and on demanding accountability of the U.S. Border Patrol for its abuse of migrants. Now it is urging the incoming administration to shift away from a decades-old “disastrous law enforcement-only approach,” she said, and toward “a human-rights-first approach that expands public safety, protects human rights, and welcomes residents and newcomers at the border.”",Biden’s Towering Conundrum: The Fate of Trump’s Border Wall
271,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/02/how-the-fossil-fuel-industry-convinced-americans-to-love-gas-stoves/,MJ,Far Left,"In early 2020, Wilson Truong posted on the Nextdoor social media platform—where users can send messages to a group in their neighborhood—in a Culver City, California, community. Writing as if he were a resident of the Fox Hills neighborhood, Truong warned the group members that their city leaders were considering stronger building codes that would discourage natural gas lines in newly built homes and businesses. In a message with the subject line “Culver City banning gas stoves?” Truong wrote: “First time I heard about it I thought it was bogus, but I received a newsletter from the city about public hearings to discuss it…Will it pass???!!! I used an electric stove but it never cooked as well as a gas stove so I ended up switching back.” Truong’s post ignited a debate. One neighbor, Chris, defended electric induction stoves. “Easy to clean,” he wrote about the glass stovetop, which uses a magnetic field to heat pans. Another user, Laura, was nearly incoherent in her outrage. “No way,” she wrote, “I am staying with gas. I hope you can too.” What these commenters didn’t know was that Truong wasn’t their neighbor at all. He was writing in his role as account manager for the public relations firm Imprenta Communications Group. Imprenta’s client was Californians for Balanced Energy Solutions (C4BES), a front group for SoCalGas, the nation’s largest gas utility, working to fend off state initiatives to limit the future use of gas in buildings. C4BES had tasked Imprenta with exploring how social media platforms, including Nextdoor, could be used to foment community opposition to electrification. Though Imprenta assured me this Nextdoor post was an isolated incident, the C4BES website displays Truong’s comment next to two other anonymous Nextdoor comments as evidence of their advocacy work in action. The Nextdoor incident is just one of many examples of the newest front in the gas industry’s war to garner public support for their fuel. As more municipalities have moved to phase gas lines out of new buildings to cut down on methane emissions, gas utilities have gone on the defensive, launching anti-electrification campaigns across the country. To ward off a municipal vote in San Luis Obispo, California, during the pandemic, a union representing gas utility workers threatened to bus in “hundreds” of protesters with “no social distancing in place.” In Santa Barbara, California, residents have received robotexts warning a gas ban would dramatically increase their bills. The Pacific Northwest group Partnership for Energy Progress, funded in part by Washington state’s largest natural gas utility, Puget Sound Energy, has spent at least $1 million opposing heating electrification in Bellingham and Seattle, including $91,000 on bus ads showing a happy family cooking with gas next to the slogan: “Reliable. Affordable. Natural Gas. Here for You.” In Oklahoma, Arizona, Louisiana, and Tennessee, where electrification campaigns have not yet taken off, the industry has worked aggressively with state legislatures to pass laws—up to a dozen are in the works—that would prevent cities from passing cleaner building codes.   The industry group American Gas Association has a website dedicated to promoting cooking with gas. There’s a good reason for these Herculean efforts: Suddenly, the industry finds itself defending against electrification initiatives nationwide. And the behind-the-scenes lobbying is only one part of its massive anti-electrification crusade. Gas companies have launched an unusually effective stealth campaign of direct-to-consumer marketing to capture the loyalty and imaginations of the public. Surveys have found that most people would just as soon switch their water heaters and furnaces from gas to electric versions. So, gas companies have found a different appliance to focus on: gas stoves. Thanks in large part to gas company advertising, gas stoves—like granite countertops, farm sinks, and stainless-steel refrigerators—have become a coveted kitchen symbol of wealth, discernment, and status, not to mention a selling point for builders and realtors. Until now, the stove strategy has been remarkably successful. But as electrification initiatives gain momentum, gas companies’ job is getting harder. Now that the industry is getting desperate, parts of its public relations infrastructure have begun cooling on this once-hot client. Gas connections in American houses are at an all-time high. The share of gas stoves in newly constructed single-family homes climbed from below 30 percent in the 1970s to around 50 percent in 2019 (the data obviously excludes apartment buildings). Today, gas usage for heating, water, and cooking is uneven across the country. Data shows 35 percent of Americans use a gas stove, though in some of the most populous cities—particularly those in New York, Illinois, and California—well over 70 percent of the population relies on gas for cooking. Residences also make up the lion’s share of the gas utility profits, making gas appliances a pivotal source for the future of industry growth. Yet the popularity of gas may soon begin to wane. Americans are waking up to the fact that natural gas is a powerful contributor to climate change and source of air pollution—and that’s not even counting gas pipelines’ tendency to leak and explode. Climate emissions from gas and oil-powered buildings make up a full 12 percent of US greenhouse gas emissions. Just a couple of decades ago, electricity wasn’t the obviously cleaner choice. Now it’s the main strategy for cleaning stubborn sources of pollution. If homes are fully electric, they’re bound to rely increasingly on renewable energy like solar and wind, but every new home that connects to the gas grid today will still be using fossil fuels in 15 years, no matter how much we clean up the electricity sector. Already at least 42 municipalities across the United States have strengthened building codes to discourage expanding gas hookups in new construction, and the pace is picking up. New York City may soon join that number, while Seattle has settled for a compromise that bans gas appliances in commercial and multifamily homes without technically banning the stove in new construction. In 2021, Washington state will propose bans for gas furnaces and heating after 2030. California regulators have faced pressure to pass the most aggressive standards in the nation to make all newly constructed buildings electric by 2023. Biden’s campaign promised to implement new appliance and building-efficiency standards. Even with all the gas industry lobbying on the state level, more stringent federal rules could motivate builders to ditch the gas hookups for good in new construction.  The dangers of gas stoves go beyond just heating the planet—they can also cause serious health problems. Gas stoves emit a host of dangerous pollutants, including particulate matter, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Carbon monoxide poisoning is a known killer, which homeowners assume can be prevented with detectors. But new research shows that the standard sensor doesn’t always pick up potentially dangerous carbon monoxide emissions—if a home even has working sensor at all. Nitrogen dioxide, which is not regulated indoors, has been linked to an increased risk of heart attacks, asthma, and other respiratory disease. In May, a literature review by the think tank RMI highlighted EPA research that found homes with gas stoves have anywhere between 50 and 400 percent higher concentrations of nitrogen dioxide than homes without. Children are especially at risk, according to a study by UCLA Fielding School of Public Health commissioned by Sierra Club: Epidemiological research suggests that kids in homes with gas stoves are 42 percent more likely to have asthma than children in homes with electric stoves. Running a stove and oven for just 45 minutes can produce pollution levels that would be illegal outdoors. One 2014 simulation by the Berkeley National Laboratory found that cooking with gas greatly increases carbon monoxide pollution by adding up to 3,000 parts per billion of carbon monoxide into the air after an hour—raising indoor carbon monoxide concentrations up to one-third for the average home. Shelly Miller, a University of Colorado, Boulder, environmental engineer who has studied indoor air quality for decades, explains that household gas combustion is essentially the same as in a car. “Cooking,” she adds, “is the number one way you’re polluting your home. It is causing respiratory and cardiovascular health problems; it can exacerbate flu and asthma and COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease] in children.” Without ventilation, “you’re basically living in this toxic soup.” Over the last century, the gas industry has worked wonders to convince Americans that cooking with a gas flame is superior to using electric heat. Gas companies have urged us not to think too hard—if at all—about what it means to combust a fossil fuel in our homes. The gas and electric industries have been in a tug-of-war for dominance in buildings for well over a century. In the early 1900s, gas utilities looked “to other uses for their product; hence the intensive campaign in favor of cooking with gas,” a 1953 newspaper story from the Indiana Terre Haute Tribune reported. The story explains that “gas salesmen knocked on many doors before housewives would turn to gas for cooking fuel.” The industry embraced the term “natural gas,” which gave the impression that its product was cleaner than any other fossil fuel: A 1934 ad bragged, “The discovery of Natural Gas brought to man the greater and most efficient heating fuel which the world has ever known. Justly is it called—nature’s perfect fuel.”   In the 1930s, the industry invented the catch phrase “cooking with gas,” and by the 1950s it was targeting housewives with star-studded commercials of matinee idols scheming how to get their husbands to renovate their kitchens. In a newspaper advertisement by the Pennsylvania People’s Natural Gas Company in 1964, the star Marlene Dietrich vouched, “Every recipe I give is closely related to cooking with gas. If forced, I can cook on an electric stove but it is not a happy union.” (That was around the same time General Electric waged an advertising campaign starring the future president Ronald Reagan that showed an all-electric house as the Jetson-like future for a modern home.) In 1988 the industry produced a cringeworthy rap about stoves. “I cook with gas cause the cost is much less/ Than ‘lectricity, do you want to take a guess?” and “I cook with gas cause broiling’s so clean/ The flame consumes the smoke and grease.”  Beginning in the 1990s, the gas industry faced an extra challenge: the mounting evidence that gas in our homes causes serious health problems. Its main strategy has been to exploit the lack of regulation and the uncertainties of science to help lull the public into indifference. Environmentalists say the strategy harks back to how the tobacco industry fought evidence of the dangers of smoking.  The industry claims that there are no documented risks to one’s health from gas stoves, citing the lack of regulation from the US Consumer Product Safety Commission and the EPA as evidence of why the public shouldn’t be concerned. (To be clear, the EPA has not said gas stoves are safe. Indeed, its 2016 Integrated Science Assessment was the first time the agency linked short-term and long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide to health problems like asthma. UCLA public health researchers found that indoor nitrogen dioxide emissions from running a stove and oven can rival that from outdoor levels the EPA would consider illegal. Indeed, UCLA data shows California’s biggest source of NO2 emissions comes not from power plants, but from gas appliances.) The industry also claims that proper ventilation mitigates some of the risks of cooking with gas. That’s true, but mostly impractical: Many American families can’t afford to install an exhaust hood, a chimney-like vent that sucks up the emissions and releases them outside, and there’s certainly no regulation requiring it. Instead, most homes just have fans above the stove that recirculate the polluted air inside the home, or nothing at all. Because of dated building codes and the unregulated market, low-income Americans have to put up with gas filling their homes with invisible pollutants in cramped spaces. In the last few years, the industry has encountered increasing resistance to its claims that natural gas is perfectly safe. Last June, I published a piece that exposed how gas groups representing utilities hired social media influencers to convince millennials and Gen Xers that gas stoves are the superior way to cook. The two main campaigns are the work of the gas trade groups the American Public Gas Association, a collection of public and municipal utilities, and the American Gas Association, which is comprised of privately owned utilities. These groups have hired prominent public relations firms to seek out influencers who emphasize—and whose presence embodies—the cool factor of gas cooking while mentioning none of the risks. In fact, in the posts I reviewed, none of the influencers appeared to have a hood over their stoves, or even to mention ventilation. I knew I had caught the industry’s attention with the story when many of the Instagram posts embedded in the piece were soon deleted, and I started receiving long, mostly unsolicited emails from the industry’s various consultants. I didn’t know how they had reacted to the negative press until I read a trove of emails obtained through a public records request by the fossil fuel watchdog Climate Investigations Center. According to the emails, representatives from the public relations firm Porter Novelli reached out to their client American Public Gas Association, which then asked gas execs at several utilities, if its campaign should be paused in light of the backlash. The answer was a definitive no. “They should not stop for even 1 hour,” one utility executive, industry veteran Sue Kristjansson, replied in an email. “And….if they are saying that we are paying influencers to gush over gas stoves so be it. Of course we are and maybe we should pay them to gush more?” The emails show gas executives debating their next move: Some thought they should tell the influencers to emphasize guidance around proper ventilation for gas stoves; others, including Kristjansson, wanted to downplay the risks posed by gas stoves altogether. Kristjansson worried that giving even an inch to the critics would be the same as admitting defeat. “If we wait to promote natural gas stoves until we have scientific data that they are not causing any air quality issues we’ll be done,” Kristjansson wrote.

 (Since she sent those emails, Kristjansson has moved on to become the president of Berkshire Gas in Massachusetts. When I reached her for comment about her dismissal of the science, the utility sent me a statement on her behalf, repeating familiar claims: “The science around the safe use of natural gas for cooking is clear: there are no documented risks to respiratory health from natural gas stoves from the regulatory and advisory agencies and organizations responsible for protecting residential consumer health and safety.”) Yet Kristjannson’s hard-liner approach of downplaying the health risks of natural gas seems to be losing favor. Take the example of Kate Arends, the founder of Wit and Delight, a polished lifestyle website for “designing a life well-lived,” and an Instagram account with more than 300,000 followers. Arends’ brand fits perfectly into the affluent female demographic that the gas industry wants to target—and indeed, at least one of Arends’ posts is sponsored by APGA.",How the Fossil Fuel Industry Convinced Americans to Love Gas Stoves
272,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/02/trumps-wall-feels-like-if-someone-got-a-knife-and-dragged-it-across-my-heart/,MJ,Far Left,"Arizona leaders and activists hold a rally in Tucson in 2019 to protest construction of the border wall, which they said would block animal migration, destroy Native American sites, and harm endangered species. Christopher Brown/ZUMA This story is the second of three installments in a series by High Country News and Arizona Public Media and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. The first installment is reprinted here. By the time President Donald Trump left office, contractors had erected a wall along just over 450 miles of the international boundary with Mexico. Nearly 230 miles of it was in Arizona, according to figures provided by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The new wall stops short of some 60 miles of border located in the Tohono O’odham Nation, but it hasn’t spared the O’odham tribes’ ancestral land, which spreads across central and southern Arizona and into northern Mexico. The Gadsden Purchase of 1853 sliced the O’odham homeland in half more than a century ago, and over the last year, the Trump administration’s steel bollard wall has carved another deep scar into it. Verlon Jose, the former vice chairman of the Tohono O’odham Nation, now serves as one of the traditional O’odham leaders in Mexico. Jose told me, “When people ask me, ‘What does this feel like to you?’ It feels like if someone got a knife and dragged it across my heart.” Tribal members have watched as wall segments were cut through sacred sites and traditional homesteads. Construction crews used dynamite on burial grounds and cut down century-old saguaros. In January, President Joe Biden’s executive order temporarily halted all construction and reversed his predecessor’s 2019 emergency declaration, which Trump had used to obtain military funds for the wall. Still, Jose said, a great deal has already been damaged or destroyed. “Now tell me if that is repairable and (can) go back to its original state, as God the creator intended for it to be,” he said. “I think the answer is, ‘No.’ It’s going to be a scar that’s going to be there forever.” Now, communities that have spent years resisting border wall construction through court filings, online campaigns and on-the-ground protests are waiting to see how the fate of the Borderlands will change under the Biden administration.  Workers relocate a saguaro cactus at Organ Pipe National Monument in October 2019 near Lukeville, Arizona. More than 100 endangered cacti, including 76 saguaros, had to be relocated for the border wall project. Jerry Glaser via ZUMA Wire In some areas, the new wall simply replaced the old, waist-high vehicle barriers. But in others, contractors tore into rugged desert wilderness to build where nothing existed before. From her front window, Ammi Robles, a Mexican artist who lives in Agua Prieta, can see a blank cement wall, an older border barrier, while new construction has been appearing everywhere. Robles used to make weekly trips across the border to Douglas, something that hasn’t been possible in the last year because of COVID-19 border closures. But even before then, she said, the new walls made it harder to feel connected. “It feels like they’re pushing us away. I don’t want to say that I feel resentment, but I kind of feel that way,” she said. “Like they’re closing themselves, like, ‘We don’t really need Agua Prieta.'” The wall is not just eroding community ties, advocates argue; it’s impacting shared natural resources. Alejandro Olivera, senior Mexico representative for the Center for Biological Diversity, said wall contractors are pumping out precious groundwater that is supposed to be used by both countries. “They are shared within the two nations, so they are pumping the water that should be considered and discussed with the Mexican government before they do these kinds of activities,” he said. Olivera was one of a few dozen environmentalists and tribal representatives from both sides of the border who co-signed a letter asking Mexican officials to work with Biden to end wall construction.  Even U.S. federal assessments have doubted the project’s efficacy. An Office of Inspector General report called the wall “outdated,” saying the Trump administration failed to use “sound methodology” and did not properly consider the project’s multibillion-dollar cost to taxpayers. Still, the Trump administration waived dozens of environmental and cultural protection laws to push the project through. In January, southern Arizona Congressman Raúl Grijalva told reporters he wanted to see the repeal of the Real ID Act, the 2005 law that made those waivers possible. “It has been the driver, particularly on public land and border communities, in the suspension of those civil laws, protection, public processes and civil rights,” he said. “That’s a legislative initiative we hope to begin almost immediately.” Grijalva said he plans to push for restoration efforts, including potentially removing parts of the wall in sensitive areas. But with so much already built, some worry it’s too late, especially in places like Quitobaquito Springs — an ancient water source and manmade pond located on ancestral O’odham land along the border in Organ Pipe National Monument in Arizona. Last summer, the spring flow dropped to a record low; the pond began to dry up, and cracked mud flats appeared where water once shimmered. At the same time, stacks of steel wall panels appeared near the site. In recent years, drought, agricultural pumping and cracks in the pond’s lining had depleted Quitobaquito’s water. But environmental and tribal advocates say that wall contractors are exacerbating the problem by pumping groundwater to mix cement. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Rob Daniels acknowledged that the project has extracted some 45 million gallons from nearby wells. Long before it was part of Organ Pipe, Quitobaquito was a traditional Hia C-ed O’odham homestead. Families lived there until the 1950s, when the land was bought by the National Park Service. Nellie Jo David said that watching the new wall go up reminded her of what happened to her Hia C-ed O’odham relatives decades ago. “These lands which are so-called national monuments are actually unceded territories in which Indigenous people have been pushed off and intentionally erased,” she said. David and Amber Lee Ortega another Hia C-ed O’odham woman, were praying and singing there one morning last September when construction crews began work a few paces away. The two women were arrested by National Park Service officers for climbing into machinery and forcing work to a halt. Their arrests marked an escalation in a series of Indigenous-led demonstrations to save Quitobaquito. More protesters were teargassed, shot with rubber bullets and arrested, even as the wall continued to inch closer to the site. In December, a Customs and Border Protection spokesperson confirmed that the wall in Organ Pipe had been completed, though crews were still installing lighting and building roads by the time Biden ordered the construction to a halt.  “The damage has already been done,” David said. “I understand there’s a big push to stop, which is good,” she went on, “but what we really need is a removal and a restoration.” Still, there’s no telling when, or if, that removal will occur. In January, the Arizona Democratic Party passed a resolution calling for a series of reforms in the Borderlands, including removing certain sections of the wall and compensating Indigenous groups whose sites have been destroyed. Biden, however, has never publicly supported tearing sections down. David said she isn’t putting too much faith in what happens on Capitol Hill. Instead, she finds inspiration closer to home.  “I don’t have hope because of the coming administration,” she said. “I have hope because of what we have done as communities to stand up.” Alisa Reznick covers border and immigration issues for Arizona Public Media in Tucson. ",Trump’s Wall “Feels Like if Someone Got a Knife and Dragged It Across My Heart”
273,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/02/damage-wrought-by-trumps-border-wall-will-not-ever-be-remediated-or-mitigated/,MJ,Far Left,"Roberto E. Rosales/ Albuquerque Journal/ ZUMA This story is the first of three installments published by High Country News and Arizona Public Media and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. In the last year and a half, crews have raced to complete the border wall promised by President Donald Trump. By the time his term ended, many of the construction projects across Arizona’s Borderlands were complete. As President Joe Biden takes charge, environmental groups are taking stock of the environmental destruction caused by the wall as they make the case for restoration. Much of Arizona’s international border with Mexico is made up of public lands, places set aside by the federal government for special protection because of their unique ecological value—Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, the San Pedro National Riparian Conservation Area, and Cabeza Prieta and San Bernardino national wildlife refuges, among others. So when the Trump administration released its first plans for new border wall construction in Arizona in May 2019, environmentalists were horrified to see that nearly all the proposed wall segments were on those public lands. The administration “really started to push out into remote, rugged terrain on public lands all across the borderline in Arizona, where the ecological value of those places is so much higher that the damage done by this construction is much more egregious,” said Randy Serraglio, Southwest conservation advocate with the Center for Biological Diversity. “This is damage that will not ever be remediated or mitigated,” Serraglio said. “This is permanent.”For months now, construction crews have been dynamiting, drilling, pumping, excavating and clear-cutting public land. In places like Guadalupe Canyon in far eastern Arizona, simply building roads to bring in construction equipment involved blasting mountainsides and sending the rubble down to clog drainages. Previously wide-open landscapes where wildlife and water could move freely have been severed by the huge steel barrier. The Sonoran Desert’s iconic saguaros, protected by law, have been found lying in heaps next to construction sites. Under the Trump administration, contractors have replaced barbed wire or waist-high barriers with 30-foot-high steel beams, 6 inches wide, with only a 4-inch gap in-between. “Nothing larger than a cottontail rabbit could pass through there,” said Myles Traphagan, Borderlands program coordinator with the Wildlands Network. “So the common wildlife you see along the border, such as javelina, deer, mountain lion, bobcat, bighorn sheep, those are going to be completely impeded by this border wall.” Traphagan’s organization works closely with ranches in Mexico that prioritize wildlife protection and cross-border migration corridors. He said their game cameras used to capture images of hundreds of animals per month traveling the drainages near San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge. “But the last few times I’ve been down there, those numbers have just plummeted,” he said. Then there’s the impacts of water use: In many places, contractors have pumped water from deep belowground for construction purposes, wetting roads to keep the dust down or to make cement. Because Arizona doesn’t require data on water usage from wells in these areas, there are no hard numbers on how much has been used, but some impacts are already clear. Quitobaquito is a rare desert spring in Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, located on the ancestral homelands of O’odham tribes. Despite promises from U.S. Customs and Border Protection that the builders would respect a five-mile buffer around the spring and its pond, hydrologists and ecologists who monitor the site said last year that the pond dropped to its lowest levels in years after pumping began for the border wall. Since February 2020, CBP has withdrawn 45 million gallons of water around Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. In the southeast corner of Arizona, the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Its artesian-fed wetlands and springs support several threatened and endangered species, including the Yaqui topminnow, Yaqui chub, beautiful shiner and Yaqui catfish. Traphagan said the wall contractors installed higher-capacity pumps to keep the refuge wells from drying up completely. “Right now, the refuge is on a ventilator. Because those flows would stop if they didn’t have the pumps installed,” Traphagan said.Last summer, documents obtained by the Center for Biological Diversity via the Freedom of Information Act revealed that nearby groundwater pumping for the border wall—as much as 700,000 gallons per day—was depleting the refuge’s wetlands. That ultimately forced staff to relocate fish and allow some wetlands to dry up in an effort to protect the species. A year ago, hundreds of protesters gathered along the San Pedro River, one of the Southwest’s last free-flowing rivers and a jewel of southern Arizona, to protest the plan to build a border wall across the riverbed. But despite active opposition by environmentalists, local residents and members of Congress, construction continued. By November, that wall was complete. “That river is a lifeline for hundreds and hundreds of species; millions of migratory birds use it as a flyway every year,” Serraglio said. “And yet they have constructed a wall right across the riverbed that will almost certainly act as a dam and completely disrupt the normal ecological functioning of that river.” Compounding the environmental impacts is the fact that 2020 was one of the driest and hottest years on record. For parts of the wall that cut across riverbeds and water crossings, Traphagan said, that means that some of the true impacts, such as flooding and erosion, have yet to be seen. The long-term impacts of severing wildlife corridors are also unknown, he said. “We have walled off 75% of the continent from the Rio Grande to (the) Pacific Ocean,” he said. “By doing so, we’re conducting an uncontrolled ecological experiment that is going to potentially alter the evolutionary history of North America for decades to come if these walls remain intact.” Climate change also means that rare desert water sources are becoming even harder to find, so that animals need more room to roam, not less, said Emily Burns with the Sky Island Alliance, a conservation group. “In 2020, there was an incredible drought. It’s not over yet, and we’ve seen springs in the Borderlands completely dry up,” Burns said. “Animals now have this double insult of not being able to walk as far to find water because they’re cut off by the wall.” In March, months before construction began in the wider region, her group installed a series of game cameras along part of the U.S.-Mexico border to gather data on cross-border animal migration. The initial results, which detected more than 100 different species, have been very encouraging, she said. That’s because the mountainous region where the cameras are located is an incredibly biodiverse area. Burns hopes her camera data can be used to convey a bit of what wildlife migration was like before the new wall was built. “Each species is going to respond differently to the border wall. We need to understand how they’re being impacted so we can work on a multi-species conservation strategy to minimize the damage that’s already been done by the wall,” she said. This is one of the fundamental problems with any recovery or restoration of the Borderlands now that wall construction has ended or been stopped, said Serraglio. In order to speed construction, the Trump administration waived dozens of federal environmental and cultural resource laws that normally apply to such projects—laws that were created to minimize or mitigate their impacts. “We don’t really have the baseline science to be able to determine what all of the impacts are going to be, because all of the environmental laws that would have required that kind of analysis were waived,” he said. Many environmental groups have begun to make their case to the Biden administration, suggesting ways to mitigate the impacts of the wall or even remove sections of it. But because those baseline studies never happened, many are worried we’ll never know exactly what was lost in the rush to build it.",Damage Wrought by Trump’s Border Wall “Will Not Ever Be Remediated or Mitigated”
274,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/02/american-cities-are-seriously-underreporting-their-carbon-footprints/,MJ,Far Left,"grynold/Getty How much do you reckon your city contributes to climate change? If you added up the emissions from all the homes, businesses, vehicles, industries—everything that makes a city a city—what would your local carbon footprint be? If you haven’t a clue, you’re not alone. It turns out that city officials themselves are struggling to accurately self-report local emissions, according to new research out today in the journal Nature Communications. The study used Vulcan, a comprehensive emissions model developed by the researchers, to analyze 48 American cities. It found that, on average, officials are underreporting their greenhouse gas emissions by 18.3 percent. If you were to extrapolate that discrepancy to all the cities across the United States, the potentially unreported carbon would equal 129,000,000 metric tons—nearly 25 percent more than all of California’s emissions in 2015. “We’re trying to avoid just being critical without having something redeeming to say at the end of all this,” says Northern Arizona University climate scientist Kevin Gurney, lead author on the paper. City officials themselves are not at fault, he insists. They’re working with limited resources, and they’ve still been able to build impressive, though imperfect, “inventories” of their cumulative emissions. “In some ways,” says Gurney, “they’re being burdened with doing a job they shouldn’t have to do.” City officials build what’s called self-reported inventories, or SRIs, to get an idea of local emission levels. Municipal leaders then use these SRIs to develop climate action plans, aiming to trim emissions where they can. But the problem is that local governments go about this quantification in unique ways, and some may have more resources to develop a comprehensive inventory than others. Typically, municipal officials will choose between three or four existing protocols, developed by nongovernmental organizations; these generally incorporate various forms of energy consumption data and tallies of vehicle miles traveled within the city. They can also count their city’s buildings to estimate how much the built environment contributes to emissions. The result is a scattershot approach to quantifying emissions, with no national template. Officials in one city might find it difficult, for instance, to get numbers on fuel consumption in certain industries—so they leave that information out, thus underreporting overall emissions. Leaders in another city might go in the opposite direction and overreport their local footprint. Others might lose the team responsible for the SRI when an administration changes, so they will also lose their institutional knowledge of the intricacies of what went into that report; for instance, which emissions might have been left out of the tally. “If you step back from it for a minute, it seems actually like kind of a silly thing to do,” says Gurney. “Not that they shouldn’t do it, but that you shouldn’t have every single individual city having to redundantly build this information. It’s expensive. It’s difficult. It’s hard to do it systematically.” Take Flagstaff, Arizona. According to Gurney, officials there were incorporating retail sales from gas stations in the city’s SRI calculation, which is usually a perfectly reasonable way to estimate emissions from local vehicles. Emphasis on local. The issue is that Flagstaff sits on an interstate highway, and there’s no way to separate gas sales made to residents from sales made to people stopping by on their way between Albuquerque and Las Vegas. “There’s nothing technically wrong with doing that,” says Gurney of using retail gas sales as a data point. “But it’s probably not appropriate to reflect that in the emission account of the city of Flagstaff, unless they want to take responsibility for emissions that are occurring within 500 miles of the city.” Having each city build an individual SRI is like developing a national weather forecasting system by asking each county to characterize their local weather, then gathering up all those systems into one cohesive model. “Well, that wouldn’t make any sense when you’re doing weather forecasting,” says Gurney. “In the same way, a greenhouse gas emissions system shouldn’t be every single entity doing this redundantly themselves.” Instead, Gurney argues that the Vulcan system can shoulder the burden of calculating carbon levels for cities across the US. He and his colleagues have been developing the system for 15 years, incorporating two dozen data sets to thoroughly quantify sources of emissions across the country in fine detail. Vulcan looks at traffic, census, and air quality data, and takes an inventory of the emissions from all the power plants in the US. In some cities, like Los Angeles, the model is so detailed that it can discern how emissions vary block by block. The team has been able to confirm Vulcan’s modeling of emissions with atmospheric measures of CO2 across the US. And in their new research, they found that city self-reports are often out of step when compared to Vulcan’s outputs. Their study found that some places, like Flagstaff and Palo Alto, significantly overreported their emissions (by about 60 percent and 40 percent, respectively). Others, like the California city of Torrance, underreported by over 100 percent, according to the study. (The team adjusted Vulcan’s output for each city, by the way. If one left out industrial fuel use, for instance, so would Vulcan, in order to better square the results. This means that Vulcan would also come up with somewhat of an underestimation, compared to a complete report.) So why is it important to resolve these discrepancies? For one thing, city agencies can end up sinking considerable time and resources into mitigating emissions—like by creating more public transport and green spaces, or making the built environment friendlier for pedestrians—so they should have access to the most accurate data possible to figure out what to fund. And local data constantly changes as a city naturally transforms over time, so policymakers can find themselves tasked with making decisions based on a recent SRI report that’s already out of date. Vulcan, by contrast, is consistently updated every two or three years with new data across the board, which can characterize a city’s growth over time. “We’re suggesting that this needs to be done in an ongoing fashion,” says Gurney. (He says governments can reach out to his team to start digging into Vulcan’s data on their cities.) Might Vulcan, then, become a sort of standardized platform for American cities to more accurately measure their emissions? “I think that’s plausible, for sure,” says Louisiana State University environmental scientist Brian Snyder, who wasn’t involved in the work. “And I think it’d be a vast improvement upon what they’re doing right now.” What cities are best equipped to transform at the moment, Snyder argues, is transportation. “If you want to reduce your emissions from transport, you have to know what your emissions are to begin with,” Snyder says. “And one of the nice things that Vulcan does is it sort of shows you—very specifically to the grid space—where they at least think those emissions are coming from.” This could help city agencies figure out where to bolster public transportation, for instance. But there’s only so much a city can do to reduce emissions in the short term, Snyder adds. “A lot of stuff has been baked into the cake for 100 years.” Oil refineries remain a scar on the landscape for many cities, for instance. Getting data from Vulcan would be not step one, but “step zero” in how a municipality plans to cut its emissions, according to Christopher Jones, director of UC Berkeley’s CoolClimate Network, which develops climate solutions for cities. (He wasn’t involved in this new work.) “I really find a lot of value in projects like Vulcan that are trying to provide that information with no effort on the part of the cities,” Jones says. “That’s really important, but you do have to work with them to figure out what their needs are. Just giving them data isn’t useful to them.” You’d have to present the data in a way that provides context—for example, how local emissions are changing over time. And when you find an emissions reduction target to hit, city officials need options that are within their control: They can’t just tear down a power plant that runs on natural gas without providing a new, green way to immediately replace that energy. But in general, Jones points out that cities wield more immediate control over land use. For instance, local agencies can make plans to develop more green spaces. Creating accurate and standardized ways for cities to track their carbon footprint will be especially critical in the future, given that while half the world’s population currently lives in cities, that figure will skyrocket to 70 percent by 2050. Cities are already responsible for three-quarters of global CO2 emissions. On top of all that, the laws of thermodynamics dictate that cities are more vulnerable in a warmer world: They tend to be considerably hotter than rural areas, thanks to the urban heat island effect, in which the concrete soaks up the sun’s energy during the day and slowly releases the heat at night. One recent study found that by the year 2100, cities could warm as much as 4.4 degrees Celsius. “Not only will Vulcan keep pace with the growth of cities, where the world is becoming an urban world, it’ll also be able to allow for course correction,” Gurney says.",American Cities Are Seriously Underreporting Their Carbon Footprints
275,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/02/humans-are-walloping-sea-creatures-with-deadly-disorienting-noise/,MJ,Far Left,"A white beluga whale and her calf. Nagoya, Japan, 2004.AFP/Getty This story was originally published by The Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. A natural ocean soundscape is fundamental to healthy marine life but is being drowned out by an increasingly loud cacophony of noise from human activities, according to the first comprehensive assessment of the issue. The damage caused by noise is as harmful as overfishing, pollution and the climate crisis, the scientists said, but is being dangerously overlooked. The good news, they said, is that noise can be stopped instantly and does not have lingering effects, as the other problems do. Marine animals can hear over much greater distances than they can see or smell, making sound crucial to many aspects of life. From whales to shellfish, sea life uses sound to catch prey, navigate, defend territory and attract mates, as well as find homes and warn of attack. Noise pollution increases the risk of death and in extreme cases, such as explosions, kills directly. Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel burning are also making the oceans more acidic, meaning the water carries sound further, leading to an even noisier ocean, the researchers said. But the movement of marine mammals and sharks into previously noisy areas when the Covid-19 pandemic slashed ocean traffic showed that marine life could recover rapidly from noise pollution, they said. Everything from the tiniest plankton up to sharks sense their acoustic environment,” said Prof Steve Simpson at the University of Exeter in England, and part of the review team. “As a result, the animals have to produce sound to communicate, but also to receive sound.” He said noise pollution was like an “acoustic fog” in the ocean. “Marine animals can only see across tens of meters at most, and can smell across hundreds of meters, but they can hear across entire ocean basins,” said Prof Carlos Duarte at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, who led the review. Duarte said major assessments of the health of the ocean were ignoring noise: “Yet the scientific literature, when read carefully, provides compelling evidence of human-caused noise being a major source of disruption to the marine ecosystem.” The review, published in the journal Science, analysed more than 500 studies that assessed the effects of noise on sea life. About 90% of the studies found significant harm to marine mammals, such as whales, seals and dolphins, and 80% found impacts on fish and invertebrates. “Sound is a fundamental component of ecosystems, [and noise] impacts are pervasive, affecting animals at all levels,” the analysis concluded. The most obvious impact is the link between military sonar and seismic survey detonations and deafness, mass strandings, and deaths of marine mammals. But many uses of sound can be harmed, such as the hums that male toadfish use to attract females and the honks that cod use to coordinate spawning. Baleen whales produce calls to help group cohesion and reproduction that can travel across ocean basins, and humpback whales sing complex mating songs that have regional dialects. Sperm whales and various dolphins and porpoises use sonar to echolocate prey. Other animals use sound to feed: some shrimps produce a “snap” sound to stun prey. However, over the past 50 years, increased shipping has raised low-frequency noise on major routes by 32 times, the review said. Fishing vessels use sonar to find shoals of fish and bottom trawlers create rumbling noise. The construction and operation of oil rigs and offshore wind farms also cause noise pollution, as does the detonation of second world war bombs in the North Sea. “Fish, clams, crabs and corals all hear sound and use it to find healthy places to make their home,” said Simpson. “So shipping or construction noise takes away that homing sense. It also means that whales that might have lived in a family and hunted over hundreds of miles have to live within 10 miles of each other to be able to communicate. “We find that animals are directly stressed by noise as well, and so they make poor decisions that often lead to death,” he said, noting that noise from motorboats on the Great Barrier Reef in Australia leads to double the mortality from predators. There are solutions, the review found, with a retrofit of five large container ships by shipping giant Maersk in 2015 showing that new propeller designs reduce noise and also increase fuel efficiency. Quieter propellers are the top priority, said Duarte; half of shipping noise comes from just 15% of vessels. Electric motors are another possible solution, as are small reductions in speed. For example, cutting the speeds of noisy vessels in the Mediterranean from 15.6 to 13.8 knots cut noise by 50% between 2007 and 2013. Seismic surveys can also be carried out using seabed vibrators, rather than sending noise waves through the whole water column. “Cutting noise is possibly the lowest-hanging fruit to make a difference and we can change that today,” said Simpson. “I have real hope that we will hear a healthier ocean in our lifetimes.”","Humans Are Walloping Sea Creatures With Deadly, Disorienting Noise"
276,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/02/the-forgotten-history-of-wyomings-black-miners/,MJ,Far Left,"James E. Shepperson was pictured in the Seattle Republican, a now-defunct Black newspaper, on Oct. 26, 1900. This story was originally published by High Country News and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. Today, the sage and sandstone of Wyoming’s vast Red Desert show little evidence of the coal-mining town of Dana, which once stood about 150 miles west of Cheyenne. No photos of Dana have ever been found, but in 1890 it probably looked much like southwestern Wyoming’s other Union Pacific Coal Company towns: a few boardinghouses, a company-contracted general store and just enough basic amenities to keep the town functioning. The main feature likely would have been the tipple, where coal was processed. Though largely forgotten, Dana was once home to a significant population of Black miners, originally recruited by a well-known Washington state politician and community leader, James E. Shepperson. In 1890, the UPCC hired Shepperson to recruit the first Black miners specifically enlisted to work in the company’s Wyoming mines. He was a Black man who had migrated from Virginia to Roslyn, Washington, where he led the charge to bring more Black citizens to town. Working for the Northern Pacific Railway, he brought roughly 300 miners to Roslyn, where they forged a strong community. Shepperson had made a name for himself as a successful recruiter of Black miners, and so the UPCC hired him to bring workers to Dana. In early February 1890, about 200 Black miners from the Ohio area, accompanied by their families, stepped off a train in Dana — completely unaware that the company wanted to use them as strikebreakers. Recruiting laborers for the coal mines and fighting labor organizers were nothing new for the UPCC. As coal production grew in the late 1800s, company officials, like all good industrialists, focused on profits. They did this by hiring laborers from impoverished areas, primarily in Europe and Asia — people they could entice with tenuous promises of riches, land or at least opportunity. These recruitment practices inadvertently created some of the most ethnically diverse communities in the region. In the early days, the company, which owned and assigned all worker housing, routinely integrated neighborhoods. The thinking went that if members of a specific ethnic group were not housed together, they would be less likely to form unions. There were exceptions to this company rule: Native Americans weren’t sought out at all, and company bosses saw Chinese, Japanese and Korean workers as simply too different from other groups to integrate. Though the fight for workers’ rights went on for decades, in the long run, the company’s tactics failed, as unions such as the Knights of Labor became ever more integrated and influential. In a time of intense labor disputes, strikebreakers were met with scorn and sometimes violence, particularly when they were members of an already disparaged ethnic group. Moreover, according to newspaper accounts, the Black miners in Dana were union men themselves. Because of this, they refused to “usurp striking brothers,” the white miners they were brought in to replace. By this time, the whole affair was making headlines, and the company needed a cover story. So, whether through miscommunication, deliberate misrepresentation or outright company duplicity, Shepperson became an easy scapegoat.  The role of Black residents in the story of these early coal towns has often been skewed or forgotten altogether. Most of Shepperson’s recruits stayed on at the Dana mine after their insistence on a fair wage helped influence legislation regulating how coal was weighed — and thus how much miners were paid — effectively ending the strike. As for the town of Dana, it was one of only two Wyoming communities to ever have a majority Black population. But it was short-lived. In 1891, due to the inferior quality of its coal, the UPCC closed the mine, and many of Dana’s Black miners moved to nearby Wyoming coal towns. By the 1920s, places like Rock Springs and Hanna had thriving Black communities. When coal production decreased in the 1940s and 1950s, many of their descendants left for areas that offered more opportunity, such as Denver. As a result, the role of Black residents in the story of these early coal towns has often been skewed or forgotten altogether. One night soon after he arrived, Shepperson found himself in a dark, freezing barn, hiding from his own recruits: Company officials had told the newspapers that Shepperson was solely to blame for misleading the Black miners about their status as strikebreakers. He was threatened, detained and questioned, but the details of that night are lost. Somehow, however, Shepperson escaped, and resumed his life in Washington, where he was known as an honest man who worked to strengthen the Black community in Roslyn. Among his many other accomplishments, he was a founder of the Black Masonic Lodge and president of the Washington State Colored Republican Club. He remained prominent in Roslyn until his death in 1934 and is now remembered as one of the most influential Black mining leaders during that time. Whether Shepperson deliberately recruited the Dana miners as strikebreakers will probably never be known. He certainly realized that the men would already face challenges wherever they went in the U.S. due to the color of their skin. Companies that brought workers across oceans didn’t recruit experienced Black miners from just a few states away until the era of the fight for workers’ rights. But the West, despite these barriers, still offered Black miners a chance at prosperity — and people like Shepperson made it happen.    Brigida R. Blasi is a public historian and museum professional.

Ryan Garza/TNS via ZUMA Wire This story was originally published by Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. No punishment has yet fit the crime of the Flint water crisis, complete with its child poisoning and lethal outbreak of Legionnaire’s disease. After a prior investigation fell apart in 2019, Michigan state prosecutors unveiled a slew of fresh charges against nine figures involved in the fateful penny-pinching move to switch Flint’s water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River in 2014. The river’s waters, polluted from decades of industrial waste, corroded Flint’s old water pipes, releasing lead into drinking water and into the brains of thousands of children. Lead is a neurotoxin with irreversible effects and is not safe to ingest at any level. The New York Times and Education Week reported in 2019 that the percentage of Flint’s school children who qualified for individualized special education services more than doubled from 13 percent before the crisis to 28 percent after. Add to those victims, the one dozen people who did not survive their bouts with Legionnaire’s disease, a type of pneumonia that scientists linked to the water supply switch. The PBS program Frontline determined in 2019 that a total of 115 Flint residents had died of pneumonia during the outbreak, suggesting deaths attributed to Legionnaire’s had been undercounted, potentially by up to a factor of nearly 10. Seven of the nine defendants—which include former state health and communications officials, former state-appointed emergency managers, and an ex-Flint public works manager—are staring down 5 to 15 years in prison for crimes including involuntary manslaughter and perjury. Former Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, however, only faces two relatively minor counts of willfully neglecting to intervene in his underlings’ incompetence and failing to adequately protect the public against disaster. In theory, Snyder could end up in prison for a year, and prosecutors say it is possible he could face more charges. Without them, he would be getting off easy for being asleep at the wheel during one of the greatest instances of environmental injustice in recent American memory. Or was he truly “asleep”? Snyder’s excuse during the crisis and ever since is that he never knew enough to stop the falling dominoes of decisions and cover-ups happening underneath him. Yet plenty of circumstantial documentation begs the contrary. The City of Flint switched its water supply to the Flint River in April 2014. Snyder testified to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in March of 2016, saying it was not until October 2015 that he learned that Flint’s drinking water had dangerous levels of lead and not until early 2016 that he became aware of the Legionnaire’s disease epidemic. “As soon as I became aware of it,” Snyder said, “we held a press conference the next day.” However, Tim Walberg, a congressman from Michigan and member of the House Oversight Committee confronted his fellow Republican with documents indicating that senior state environmental and communications officials were emailing about concerns regarding a Legionnaire’s outbreak in Flint back in March 2015. The Detroit Free Press, reporting on documents obtained by Progress Michigan, a watchdog group, cited a March 10, 2015, email from the environmental health supervisor of Genesee County, where Flint is the most populous city, saying that the dozens of Legionnaire’s cases diagnosed at the time “closely corresponds with the timeframe of the switch to Flint River water.” (The bacteria that causes Legionnaires is naturally occurring in many water systems across the country, and one water expert believes the switch over likely exacerbated an existing bacterial issue with the supply.) The supervisor characterized the epidemic as a “significant and urgent public health issue” and said the information was “explicitly explained” to Snyder’s environmental quality officials. This month, the online investigative news site The Intercept detailed a series of back-and-forth phone calls dating back even earlier, to October 2014, between Snyder and his chief of staff Dennis Muchmore. Those calls occurred at the same time Muchmore was in dialogue with top state health officials, which included a phone call with someone at the Michigan Health and Hospital Association. A special prosecutor characterized that call as “presumably about the outbreak.” That call took place more than a year before Snyder told Congress he had found out about the deadly bacteria. That same month that General Motors realized that the switch away from the Huron River was corroding new engine parts at its Flint plant. How much logic—or humanity—should it have taken to proactively wonder what the water was doing to residents, especially children, given what it was doing to car parts? The Detroit Free Press reported that Valerie Brader, senior policy adviser and deputy legal counsel to Snyder, wrote other top aides in an October 14, 2014, email that Flint’s water was “an urgent matter to fix,” and that the supply should switch back to Lake Huron water delivered via Detroit’s regional system. Michael Gadola, then Snyder’s chief legal counsel, responded: “My Mom is a city resident. Nice to know she’s drinking water with elevated chlorine levels and fecal coliform.” Gadola, who today is a Michigan state appeals court judge, agreed Flint “should try to get back on the Detroit system as a stopgap ASAP before this thing gets too far out of control.” Yet somehow Snyder allegedly knew little or nothing of these discussions swirling about him. Two major reports have concluded the buck stopped with him. A Flint Water Task Force report, which Snyder himself commissioned, said in 2016 that while the state’s environmental agency bore “primary responsibility” for causing the Flint water crisis, Snyder bore “ultimate accountability” for decisions coming out of his office. Then a 2018 report by the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health concluded Snyder bore “significant legal responsibility” for failing to heed citizen complaints at the outset of the crisis, issue a timely emergency declaration, and wrest control from negligent state environmental and health officials. “Flint residents’ complaints were not hidden from the governor,” the report’s authors wrote. “He had a responsibility to listen and respond.” Snyder, however, has been so unscathed by what happened in Flint that Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government awarded him a prestigious research fellowship in 2019. But howls from Flint, and an online protest petition started by a Kennedy School alum and signed by nearly 7,000 people forced Snyder to withdraw from the fellowship two days after it began. The renewed spotlight on Snyder’s role in the water crisis comes at a critical time for those who work for environmental justice. Newly inaugurated President Biden has, on paper, given it unprecedented prominence in his federal agenda. Many nominees for his Cabinet have scored significant victories for communities dealing with pollution, including his nominee for attorney general, Merrick Garland, who would oversee the creation of the first environmental and climate justice unit within the Department of Justice. Snyder’s blithe attitude about Flint symbolizes the urgency with which a Biden administration must make it clear to politicians and corporations that it is no longer business-as-usual to dump on poor people and communities made up predominately of people of color. At the federal level, Biden promises a Justice Department that will “hold corporate executives personally accountable — including jail time where merited.” That is a heavy lift in a nation where corporate executives largely continue to live large no matter how many faulty planes drop out of the sky, how many defective cars kill people, how many predatory banking practices cause people to lose their homes and life savings, and how many particles of pollution causes cancer and brain damage. CEOs might get fired, they might get fined, but they rarely face bars. A paper last year by legal scholars from the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Southern California noted “the near disappearance of individual liability, especially for top executives,” in corporate crimes over the last decade. It concluded that “an enforcement regime that is limited in its ability to levy fines at an optimal level must rely on other forms of punishment — such as the imposition of liability on guilty individuals and the top executives who facilitate their crimes — to increase deterrence. Only then will corporate criminal punishment be seen as more than a cost of doing business.” Similarly, Cary Coglianese and Sierra Blazer of the Penn Program on Regulation at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, co-wrote a 2019 op-ed in The Hill during the height of the scandals surrounding Boeing, after two of its 737 Max planes crashed, killing 346 passengers and crew members. Donald Trump’s Department of Justice had prosecuted lower-level technical pilots for fraud related to the federal approval process of the Max. “Prosecutions of lower-level employees would do nothing to assure the public that incentives at the very top of the organization align with passenger safety,” the pair wrote. This month, Trump’s Justice Department announced a $2.5 billion settlement with Boeing over the fraud charges. No executive went to jail. Nadia Milleron, who lost her daughter, Samya Stumo, summed up the outcome for the Washington Post: “This is just a blip for Boeing.” To date, the Flint water crisis has been a blip for Snyder. Environmental injustice nationally will also remain a blip, if governors and CEOs can keep throwing underlings under the bus while riding off in their limousines. As it now stands, the prosecution of lower-level employees will not assure Flint residents who live with the effects of being poisoned that the law is aligned with their safety.

Mint Images via ZUMA Wire This story was originally published by Yale Environment 360 and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.  “The Trump administration was smart,” says Charles Wilkinson, an emeritus professor at the University of Colorado Law School and an expert in public land law. “They went underground and did not have broad policies, but just took all kinds of actions opening up public lands to exploitation. The most dramatic was oil and gas leasing. By and large it was parcel by parcel, and program by program. And they got away with a lot.” The oil and gas shopping spree reached its peak in the last few months of the Trump administration. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) approved the sale of 1,400 leases out of 3,000 applications, primarily in New Mexico and Wyoming — the most of any three-month period of Trump’s presidency. The rapid-fire leasing blitz was an effort to get ahead of incoming President Joe Biden’s plans to end new drilling on federal lands as part of a sweeping climate change strategy, conservationists say. “Give it all away before you go,” said Jayson O’Neill, director of the Western Values Project, a nonprofit that monitors the relationship between public lands and special interests. “It’s been four years of administratively rushed approval processes and a legal morass. It’s going to be years until the tentacles of industry can be unwrapped from every action that [the] Interior [Department] took.” The list is long. Protections for migratory birds, clean water, and endangered species have been cut back. Just last week the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said it would remove 3.4 million acres of protected habitat for the spotted owl, which conservation groups say is endangered and needs more, not fewer, protections. The size of two national monuments was shrunk substantially, including Bears Ears in Utah, which is considered sacred ground by many Native American tribes. Oil leases on 550,000 acres were auctioned off in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, fetching just $14.4 million, far less than anticipated. The BLM okayed a right-of-way for a four-lane highway through the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area in Utah and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service permitted the “incidental take” of the threatened desert tortoise, whose habitat lies in the path of the new road. And the headquarters of the Bureau of Land Management was moved from Washington, D.C. to Grand Junction, Colorado, leading many senior officials to leave the agency and thus hamstringing its effectiveness. Biden at Water Works Park in Des Moines, Iowa. Jeremy Hogan/SOPA Images via ZUMA Wire.  And in recent months, the U.S. Forest Service has been accused of rushing the process for a controversial land deal in Arizona that will trade public land sacred to the Western Apaches to the mining company Rio Tinto — the same company that destroyed a 46,000-year-old sacred site in Australia last year. Now, with Biden in office, what happens next? What can the new administration do to unscramble the litany of changes Trump and his appointees have left behind. Where do they start? It won’t be easy or quick, experts say. The Trump administration departed so far and fast from past rules and norms that it will take time to assess the changes and come up with possible solutions. The Trump administration made at least 125 rule changes to favor special interests and issued 160 executive orders, according the Western Values Project count. President Biden has an ambitious public lands agenda, radically different from his predecessor. He has pledged that on his first day in office he will issue an executive order to conserve 30 percent of America’s lands and waters by 2030, focusing on the most ecologically important areas. And his campaign website says his administration “will work with tribal governments and Congress to protect sacred sites and public lands and waters with high conservation and cultural values.” In his boldest pledge, President Biden also has promised to ban new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters. And the incoming president has appointed the first Native American to be Secretary of the Interior, Congresswoman Deb Haaland of New Mexico, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe who has voiced her opposition to oil and gas drilling on federal lands. In reversing the previous administration’s actions, experts say, one of the first places to start is with Trump’s executive orders. These are issued by the president with the stroke of a pen, and they have the force of law. They can be undone by an incoming administration the same way. President Biden has pledged to re-establish the original boundaries of Grand Staircase Escalante and Bears Ears National monuments by executive order, under the authority of the Antiquities Act. These national monuments, both in Utah, were established by President Clinton and President Obama, respectively. President Trump reduced them by a total of 2 million acres — an action met with a lawsuit filed by the affected tribes that has not yet been resolved. But many experts believe the act gives the incoming administration the authority to change the boundaries again. Some of the environmental policy changes, though, will be harder to reverse because the rules that implement key laws, such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Clean Water Act, were changed. “With the most damaging policy decisions and initiatives, the problem is when they have been done by rule-making and not executive orders and they have political support in the Senate, in particular, it can be hard to undo those things,” said Jim Lyons, the deputy assistant secretary for Land and Mineral Management at the Interior Department under Obama. For example, rule changes to NEPA, one of the nation’s bedrock environmental laws, made it easier for “categorical exclusions” that allow the Forest Service to bypass requirements for environmental analysis of logging projects under 2,800 acres, roads as long as 2 miles, and special permits that allow private entities to use up to 20 acres. Environmental groups and attorneys general in some states are now suing the Forest Service to overturn the new rule. And the Trump administration changed the rules of the landmark Migratory Bird Treaty Act, allowing — without penalty — the incidental killing of birds from an oil spill, electrocution by power lines, or collisions with wind turbines. The plethora of oil and gas leases may be one of the most difficult problems to undo because they involve property rights. “Once they [companies] have those leases, they last for 10 years, and they are often renewed,” said Lyons. It took some 40 years of bureaucratic decisions and court actions before leases in the Badger Two Medicine Wilderness of Montana, an area important to the nearby Blackfeet tribe, were canceled last year. In the meantime, development of oil and gas leases could cause environmental damage. Lyons noted that the Trump Interior Department had targeted leasing in sensitive habitats, like the priority sage grouse conservation areas. He believes this may have been done for spite. To keep the bird from having to be listed as endangered, the Obama administration made it a priority to protect sage grouse habitat, and Trump had a well-known antipathy toward Obama’s legacy. “The damage is economic as well as ecological because we are giving away these leases at rock bottom prices,” Lyons said. One of the hurdles to undoing the long list of changes to public land and environmental policies, experts say, is that Trump appointed so many conservative judges to federal courts, which is where many lawsuits on these issues end up. In four years he appointed 226 judges, while Obama in eight years appointed 320. On the all-important federal appeals courts, Trump appointed 54 judges, one shy of Obama’s two-term total of 55, and on several of those courts Trump changed the balance from Democratic to Republican appointees. He also appointed conservative jurist Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court. As a U.S. district court judge, Gorsuch ruled against deference to federal agencies and their expertise, which experts say could have serious repercussions for conservation. The new alignment of the courts may be one reason why Biden will find it difficult to keep his promise of ending oil and gas drilling on public lands. Any effort to ban oil and gas development would run into a buzzsaw of opposition, legal and political, in Republican and Democratic states alike, where revenue from oil and gas leasing helps support state budgets for roads, schools, and public services. And changing the decisions the Trump Administration made, or putting forward new policies, sets up the possibility of an array of new conflicts in a nation that seems to become more polarized and angry by the day. Many Westerners have made it clear they will resist changes in public land and environmental policies, sometimes by force, as in the case of the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge by armed far-right extremists in 2016. The sage grouse could be one of those issues. Trump’s extensive leasing in critical sage grouse habitat could worsen the bird’s precarious state, leading to renewed calls to list it as an endangered species in many Western states — a move that would surely arouse the ire of Trump’s most ardent supporters. In addition, a Biden ban on fossil fuel exploration and development on public lands could mean conflicts over a loss of jobs and revenue. A recent analysis by the oil and gas industry in New Mexico said that the state would lose $1 billion a year in revenue if all public land drilling ceases. Conservationists are urging Biden to be proactive on public lands issues, not just reactive. Although Trump rescinded the roadless rule for Alaska, to allow more logging and other development in the Tongass National Forest, tens of millions of acres of national forest are still protected by it. “Take the roadless rule to Congress, make it harder to amend, and expand it,” said Wilkinson. He believes Biden will also add to the country’s national monuments, an effective tool for protecting highly valued lands. “You can do great things with national monuments,” he said. As the Biden administration takes over, critics say the Trump legacy on public lands and environmental issues is clear. “The most extractive ever and the furthest from where public opinion rests,” said Wilkinson. “It will go down as the worst administration ever on the public lands.”",Trump’s Public Lands Giveaways Won’t Easily Be Reversed
279,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/01/sleek-legendary-huge-vulnerable-worlds-orcas-are-under-threat/,MJ,Far Left,"Orcas swimming through the San Juan Islands.Bkamprath/Getty This story was originally published by Atlas Obscura and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. Sleek. Legendary. Huge. Extremely vulnerable. That is the picture emerging from new research on killer whales from California to British Columbia to Alaska. Revered by some indigenous cultures as guardians of the sea and reincarnations of chiefs, orcas are apex predators whose numbers have dwindled. The new study is one of the first in-depth examinations into the causes of their mortality. Known as “killer whales” for their ability to prey on larger whales, orcas in the Pacific Northwest have suffered from fatal encounters with ships and other vessels, malnutrition, disease, and accidental stranding due to sudden shifts in tides, according to the study, recently published in PLOS One. The goal of the research, led by the British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture and involving multiple agencies and institutions in Canada and the United States, is to offer insights to help improve conservation and management efforts. The study analyzed pathology reports in 53 cases of orcas found stranded in the eastern Pacific Ocean and Hawaiʻi between 2004 and 2013, and determined the cause of death in about half of the cases. Fatalities involving human interaction occurred in every age category, the researchers found. “About 40 percent of the southern residents died of a ship strike,” says lead author Stephen Raverty, referring to an endangered group that ranges from Southern California to central Vancouver Island in British Columbia. “They migrate seasonally, going off-shore in fall/winter and then returning in large numbers to feed in areas that coincide with salmon runs. Many of these salmon runs occur in areas with active fisheries, and where there may be large shipping lanes.” Fish hooks were found in two cases, adding to prior evidence that fishing gear can pose hazards to orcas, particularly younger and less experienced animals. Other causes identified in the study include parasites and congenital defects. By analyzing post-mortem records, along with data from a separate group of 35 stranded animals, the researchers established baseline data for evaluating the health of the animals, in addition to what ended their lives. Raverty, a veterinary pathologist for the Ministry of Agriculture, says the research was spurred in part by a significant drop during the 1990s in the southern resident population, to under 80 animals, where it remains today. (The northern population, ranging from mid–Vancouver Island to Alaska, is relatively healthy, he says.) Raverty and coauthor Joseph Gaydos, a wildlife veterinarian and science director for the SeaDoc Society, a marine conservancy at the University of California Davis, discovered that little work existed before 1998 to understand causes of death and trends in orca mortality. The largest species of dolphin, orcas are social animals that live in family groups and hunt in pods, employing clever strategies such as trying to tip a seal off an ice floe into open water. Individuals are readily identified by unique white patches near their eyes and dorsal fins. The animals are an integral part of indigenous folklore and totems in the Pacific Northwest; one legend describes their creation from the mating of a black whale and white osprey that fell in love. Their deep family bonds make orcas powerful symbols in the shíshálh Nation, which actively participated in the 2016 recovery of the remains of an 18-year-old male orca, J34, which likely died from vessel-inflicted trauma off the coast of the shíshálh village of Sechelt in British Columbia. The Nation’s director of resource management, skenaw “Sid” Quinn, helped mobilize local fisherman to work with the Canadian Coast Guard and others to bring the body to shore and conduct a necropsy. “Killer whales represent family in our culture,” says Quinn. “When we were out there, it felt like we were looking for a family member. And as stewards of our resources, it was really important to find out why such a healthy young male would become deceased.” The recovery and subsequent composting of the body were accompanied by shíshálh prayers, songs, and ceremonies, such as attendees brushing themselves with cedar branches to clear away spirits, he adds. The 22-foot-long skeleton of J34—named kwentens Ɂe te sinkwu (“Guardian of the Sea”) by elders—is now displayed in the shíshálh Nation tems swiya Museum in Sechelt to illuminate the importance of orcas in both the culture and nature. As top predators whose prey ranges from salmon to seals, sea lions, sharks, and whales, orcas can reveal the cumulative toll of human activity on the intricate web of life. Separate studies have shown that contaminants from industrial runoff can be carried up the food chain, concentrating in apex predators such as orcas, and affecting their hormonal function and reproductive success. The milk of mother orcas can even pass the toxins on to their calves. Raverty says the researchers hope their data will not only aid agencies such as the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administation and Canada’s Department of Fisheries and Oceans, but also encourage field biologists, research scientists, and the public to share observations about abnormalities or odd behaviors in killer whales so that they can be tracked. “Because orcas are so long-lived and high in the food chain,” he says, “they really do give us insights in terms of ecosystem health.” It’s a lesson that’s long been held in the shíshálh Nation. As xwash “Steven” Feschuk, the director of culture, puts it: “The stalashen—the orca—inhabits a lot of the qualities that our people have; whether we’re out fishing, hunting, singing, or being within our land, we’re always relying on one other to help and support each other. We all are here within this world and we all have a role in how we live and affect it.”",Sleek. Legendary. Huge. Vulnerable. Orcas Are Under Threat.

At a press conference prior to the signing, former Secretary of State John Kerry, now the United States’ first special presidential envoy for climate, stressed that improving the economy and facing the climate crisis are not mutually exclusive. “Workers have been fed a false narrative,” he said. “They’ve been fed the notion that somehow, dealing with climate is coming at their expense. No it’s not.” Echoing proponents of the Green New Deal, he added that the goal was to employ people in disadvantaged communities to construct a green energy infrastructure.

281,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/01/timber-unity-capitol-riot/,MJ,Far Left,"On Feb. 6, 2020, Timber Unity protesters showed up at the Oregon state capitol in Salem protesting a carbon cap-and-trade bill.Robin Loznak, Zuma In March, my colleague Ali Breland and I wrote about a pro-logging, anti-climate group called Timber Unity that helped to scuttle Oregon legislation for cap-and-trade in 2019 and 2020. To the average Oregon voter, Timber Unity appeared to be an organic backlash fueled by frustrated rural voters in a state dominated by Democrats. The group’s rallies, which drew hundreds and sometimes thousands of truckers and loggers to the capitol, made it appear that it had broad support among Republican voters. But actually, Timber Unity was founded and bankrolled by the logging industry—specifically Andrew Miller, CEO of a timber company called Stimson Lumber. At Timber Unity’s urging, in June 2019, Republican legislators staged a walkout that denied the government its two-thirds quorum to function, thus stalling climate legislation indefinitely. Timber Unity’s hijinks in the state legislature were coming to a head just as COVID-19 became a national emergency, depriving the state of a normal working legislative session at the start of the crisis. Timber Unity has been praised by state and national Republicans, and includes at least one former Oregon GOP lawmaker among its leaders. But as we reported in March, there is a troubling strain of extremism among some members of the group, and leaders have done little to denounce it:  …its participants have had no qualms associating with violent extremists and far-right groups. Several senior members have been photographed alongside members of neofascist or militia groups, and when pressed, its leadership has failed to disavow such ties. Its rallies have prominently featured messages backing QAnon, the sprawling internet conspiracy theory that posits a cabal of liberal elites are running a pedophile ring, and that has spurred real-world violence. […] Mother Jones has reviewed screenshots of members’ posts to Timber Unity’s private Facebook group that were assembled by Sunshine and local advocacy groups for his report. They document a forum awash with violent threats, conspiracy theories, and sometimes racist messages that likely violate the platform’s terms of service. Members have repeatedly posted about physically harming or even killing people with whom they disagree. “When you thought you hit a dog, but realize it’s just climate change protestors” read one meme shared in the group involving a picture of Robert Downey Jr. standing outside a stopped car expressing relief. Threats about using guns or hanging to target political opponents are common. We also reviewed posts making unambiguous threats to Gov. Brown’s life. Timber Unity’s supporters have used the group to spread conspiracy theories. In the last week, a post alleging “china/Oregon collusion to take over…timber and rural Oregon communities” accrued hundreds of likes and comments, including ones backing an “insurgency” in response or blaming coronavirus on Democrats and the Chinese. Messages have included hoaxes about George Soros, the liberal megadonor who is a frequent target of anti-semitic conspiracies, and misinformation about vaccinations and baseless claims of their harmful effects. Fast forward to this month, when the ties between Timber Unity and the alt-right became even clearer after the Capitol riots on January 6, even as the group has disavowed any association. Timber Unity board member and spokesperson Angelita Sanchez was at the rally in Washington, D.C. on January 6, posting multiple videos outside the Capitol to social media feeds and taking to Timber Unity’s private Facebook channels to “put myself right in the middle of it,” according to posts reviewed by Mother Jones. Sanchez has told local media Willamette Week she did not enter the Capitol, and her statement suggested that “both sides” were to blame for the incursion. “What happened yesterday was a consequence of big government, on both sides, playing too many games with hard-working Americans,” she said. “I cannot in good conscience support the destruction of public property and violence between American people and Capitol Police….I do not believe that anybody could have anticipated what actually happened yesterday. And the things that went on broke my heart.” Another acknowledgement of how the group has become intertwined with other right-wing groups came a week after the riot, on January 13, when Timber Unity put out this statement to its members: There will likely come a time during these sessions when we will call people to the capitols to protest legislation in a safe, lawful manner. We realize people in TU belong to other groups whose purpose is different than ours. We hope people who choose to attend the events of other organizations are mindful of personal safety and the safety of others, follow the laws, and are respectful of law enforcement.” This statement came after video surfaced showing one of Timber Unity’s endorsed politicians, Oregon Rep. Michael Nearmen, opening a door on Dec. 21 that later allowed far right, pro-Trump supporters to rush into the state capitol. Nearman has so far rebuffed pressure to resign. Then, on the eve of the inauguration, the Oregon Republican Party passed a resolution condemning the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach President Trump, and dismissed the violence in Washington, D.C. as a “‘false flag’ operation to discredit President Trump… this provided the sham motivation to impeach President Trump in order to advance the Democrat goal of seizing total power, in a frightening parallel to the February 1933 burning of the German Reichstag.” Experts say there is no question that Timber Unity has helped lay the groundwork for this new Republican extremism in Oregon. Spencer Sunshine, a sociologist who studies right-wing extremism, compiled a report last winter on Timber Unity for Oregon environmental groups and told us, “They’re both profiting off of an extremist space and refusing to distance from it while posing as mainstream organization.” Sunshine called on lawmakers to not turn a “blind eye to Timber Unity’s connections to Far Right organizations and conspiracy theories, nor should they ignore the group’s tolerance for its supporters using bigoted language and advocating actions that the overwhelming majority of Oregonians would find abhorrent.” ",Let’s Examine the Ties Between the Timber Industry and Extremists

BlackRock, the world’s biggest investment fund manager, has threatened to sell shares in the worst corporate polluters in a bid to support the goal of net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. Larry Fink, BlackRock’s chief executive, said the investor would ask companies whose shares it holds to disclose their plans to achieve net zero emissions. The new approach is set out in Fink’s annual letter to CEOs around the world. BlackRock could then divest from polluting companies in its actively managed funds—which represent about a tenth of its assets—if they did not improve. BlackRock has significant influence with companies, investors and governments because of the vast array of shares, bonds and other assets its controls, worth $8.7 trillion at the end of December. Its size makes it a major player in sustainable investment, although only $616 billion of its assets, about 7 percent, are managed with environmental, social or governance criteria taken into account. Fink said the coronavirus pandemic had increased the focus on the climate crisis among investors. “I believe that the pandemic has presented such an existential crisis—such a stark reminder of our fragility—that it has driven us to confront the global threat of climate change more forcefully and to consider how, like the pandemic, it will alter our lives,” Fink wrote. “No issue ranks higher than climate change on our clients’ lists of priorities.” BlackRock has faced significant pressure from environmental activists to improve its record on climate action, given its role as the biggest controller of shares and bonds in the world, including vast holdings of fossil fuel companies. The pledge to support net zero by 2050 brings BlackRock in line with commitments by more than 100 countries around the world, and with some of its big rivals which have already vowed not to invest in companies that pollute by 2050. Other investors have gone further. New York City on Monday announced that two of its pension funds for employees and teachers had voted to divest holdings worth $4 billion in fossil fuel companies. “Fossil fuels are not only bad for our planet and our frontline communities, they are a bad investment,” said New York’s mayor, Bill de Blasio. Part of BlackRock’s pledge will mean taking a more muscular role in its dealings with the companies whose shares it holds, including an increased willingness to vote against boards and in favor of climate resolutions and the “potential exit” from companies who do not try to improve. It will focus its efforts on 1,000 companies—up from 440 during 2020—who together account for 90 percent of emissions from BlackRock’s portfolio. The asset manager last year pledged to divest from companies who made more than 25 percent of their revenues from thermal coal, but the latest decision to threaten further divestments represents a stronger signal particularly to oil and gas extractors who do not have a plan for net zero emissions. However, the company will retain vast holdings in fossil fuel companies because of its role in providing funds that passively track investment indices, about 90% of its holdings. Even after the thermal coal pledge BlackRock owns assets worth $85 billion in coal-producing companies. Environmental activists welcomed BlackRock’s decision to consider divesting from the worst climate laggards. However, Gaurav Madan, a senior campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said its actions, including the net zero pledge, were “too little, too late”. “This doesn’t rise to the visionary leadership we need from the world’s largest investor in coal, oil and gas, and deforestation-linked commodities,” he said. BlackRock says it is not its role to force its clients to divest from fossil fuel producers, but it argues that it is making it easier for clients such as pension funds and university endowments to choose environmentally friendly investments rather than support polluters. These included new measures showing “temperature alignment” scores for equity and bond funds, further adding climate risks into its investment processes and launching new funds aligned with the net zero goal.",BlackRock Threatens to Shed Some of Its Massive Fossil Fuels Portfolio
283,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/01/earth-has-lost-more-than-28-trillion-tons-of-ice-since-1994/,MJ,Far Left,"Port Lockroy in British Antarctic territory.Imago/ZUMA Wire This story was originally published by The Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. The melting of ice across the planet is accelerating at a record rate, with the melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets speeding up the fastest, research has found. The rate of loss is now in line with the worst-case scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s leading authority on the climate, according to a paper published on Monday in the journal the Cryosphere. Thomas Slater, lead author and research fellow at the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at the University of Leeds, warned that the consequences would be felt around the world. “Sea level rise on this scale will have very serious impacts on coastal communities this century,” he said. About 28 trillion tons of ice was lost between 1994 and 2017, which the authors of the paper calculate would be enough to put an ice sheet 100 meters thick across the UK. About two thirds of the ice loss was caused by the warming of the atmosphere, with about a third caused by the warming of the seas. Over the period studied, the rate of ice loss accelerated by 57 percent, the paper found, from 0.8 trillion  tons a year in the 1990s to 1.2 trillion tons a year by 2017. About half of all the ice lost was from land, which contributes directly to global sea level rises. The ice loss over the study period, from 1994 to 2017, is estimated to have raised sea levels by 35 millimeters. The greatest quantities of ice were lost from floating ice in the polar regions, raising the risk of a feedback mechanism known as albedo loss. White ice reflects solar radiation back into space—the albedo effect—but when floating sea ice melts it uncovers dark water which absorbs more heat, speeding up the warming further in a feedback loop. Glaciers showed the next biggest loss of ice volume, with more than 6 trillion tons lost between 1994 and 2017, about a quarter of global ice loss over the period. The shrinking of glaciers threatens to cause both flooding and water shortages in some regions, because as large volumes melt they can overwhelm downstream areas, then shrunken glaciers produce less of the steady water flow needed for agriculture. Inès Otosaka, report co-author and a PhD researcher at the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, said: “As well as contributing to global mean sea level rise, mountain glaciers are also critical as a freshwater resource for local communities. The retreat of glaciers around the world is therefore of crucial importance, at both local and global scales.” The study, titled Earth’s Ice Imbalance, used satellite observations over the 23-year period to assess ice all over the globe. Previous studies have examined parts of the world rather than making a comprehensive assessment of the data. The research team included the University of Edinburgh, University College London and Earthwave, a data science organization, and was funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council.",Earth Has Lost More Than 28 Trillion Tons of Ice Since 1994
284,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/01/for-electric-car-adoption-this-battery-breakthrough-could-change-everything/,MJ,Far Left,"Hours-long charge times and a fear of getting stranded have held the industry back.Patrick Pleul/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP This story was originally published by The Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. Batteries capable of fully charging in five minutes have been produced in a factory for the first time, marking a significant step towards electric cars becoming as fast to charge as filling up petrol or diesel vehicles. Electric vehicles are a vital part of action to tackle the climate crisis but running out of charge during a journey is a worry for drivers. The new lithium-ion batteries were developed by the Israeli company StoreDot and manufactured by Eve Energy in China on standard production lines. StoreDot has already demonstrated its “extreme fast-charging” battery in phones, drones and scooters and the 1,000 batteries it has now produced are to showcase its technology to carmakers and other companies. Daimler, BP, Samsung and TDK have all invested in StoreDot, which has raised $130m to date and was named a Bloomberg New Energy Finance Pioneer in 2020. The batteries can be fully charged in five minutes but this would require much higher-powered chargers than used today. Using available charging infrastructure, StoreDot is aiming to deliver 100 miles of charge to a car battery in five minutes in 2025. “The number one barrier to the adoption of electric vehicles is no longer cost, it is range anxiety,” said Doron Myersdorf, CEO of StoreDot. “You’re either afraid that you’re going to get stuck on the highway or you’re going to need to sit in a charging station for two hours. But if the experience of the driver is exactly like fuelling [a petrol car], this whole anxiety goes away.” “A five-minute charging lithium-ion battery was considered to be impossible,” he said. “But we are not releasing a lab prototype, we are releasing engineering samples from a mass production line. This demonstrates it is feasible and it’s commercially ready.” Existing Li-ion batteries use graphite as one electrode, into which the lithium ions are pushed to store charge. But when these are rapidly charged, the ions get congested and can turn into metal and short circuit the battery. The StoreDot battery replaces graphite with semiconductor nanoparticles into which ions can pass more quickly and easily. These nanoparticles are currently based on germanium, which is water soluble and easier to handle in manufacturing. But StoreDot’s plan is to use silicon, which is much cheaper, and it expects these prototypes later this year. Myersdorf said the cost would be the same as existing Li-ion batteries. “The bottleneck to extra-fast charging is no longer the battery,” he said. Now the charging stations and grids that supply them need to be upgraded, he said, which is why they are working with BP. “BP has 18,200 forecourts and they understand that, 10 years from now, all these stations will be obsolete, if they don’t repurpose them for charging—batteries are the new oil.” Dozens of companies around the world are developing fast-charging batteries, with Tesla, Enevate and Sila Nanotechnologies all working on silicon electrodes. Others are looking at different compounds, such as Echion which uses niobium oxide nanoparticles. Tesla boss Elon Musk tweeted on Monday: “Battery cell production is the fundamental rate-limiter slowing down a sustainable energy future. Very important problem.” “I think such fast-charging batteries will be available to the mass market in three years,” said Prof Chao-Yang Wang, at the Battery and Energy Storage Technology Center at Pennsylvania State University in the US. “They will not be more expensive; in fact, they allow automakers to downsize the onboard battery while still eliminating range anxiety, thereby dramatically cutting down the vehicle battery cost.” Research by Wang’s group is being developed by the company EC Power, which he founded. It carefully increases the temperature of the battery to 60C, which enables the lithium ions to move faster, but avoids the damage to the battery usually caused by heat. He said this allowed a full charge in 10 minutes. Wang said new research published in Nature Energy on Monday showed this battery could be both affordable and eliminate range anxiety. “Finally we are achieving parity with gasoline vehicles in both cost and convenience. We have the technology for $25,000 electric cars that race like luxury sport cars, have 10-minute rechargeability and are safer than any currently on the market.” Wang noted that fast charging must also be repeatable at least 500 times without degrading the battery to give it a reasonable life and that the EC power battery can do so 2,500 times. Myersdorf said the StoreDot battery could be recharged 1,000 cycles while retaining 80% of original capacity. Anna Tomaszewska, at Imperial College London, UK, who reviewed the fast-charging batteries in 2019, was more cautious about the speed of their rollout. “I think technologies [like StoreDot’s] could start entering the market in the next five years or so. However, since they will be more difficult and expensive to manufacture, we’re likely to initially only see them in niche markets that are highly performance-driven and not as price-sensitive as electric vehicles,” she said.","For Electric Car Makers, This Battery Breakthrough Could Change Everything"
285,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/01/from-californias-central-valley-to-jakarta-our-aquifers-are-collapsing/,MJ,Far Left,"Hog Slough in the California Delta, provides water for 25 million people. Adrian Mendoza/ZUMA This story was originally published by WIRED and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. As California’s Economy skyrocketed during the 20th century, its land headed in the opposite direction. A booming agricultural industry in the state’s San Joaquin Valley, combined with punishing droughts, led to the over-extraction of water from aquifers. Like huge, empty water bottles, the aquifers crumpled, a phenomenon geologists call subsidence. By 1970, the land had sunk as much as 28 feet in the valley, with less-than-ideal consequences for the humans and infrastructure above the aquifers. The San Joaquin Valley was geologically primed for collapse, but its plight is not unique. All over the world—from the Netherlands to Indonesia to Mexico City—geology is conspiring with climate change to sink the ground under humanity’s feet. More punishing droughts mean the increased draining of aquifers, and rising seas make sinking land all the more vulnerable to flooding. According to a recent study published in the journal Science, in the next two decades, 1.6 billion people could be affected by subsidence, with potential loses in the trillions of dollars. “Subsidence has been neglected in a lot of ways because it is slow moving. You don’t recognize it until you start seeing damage,” says Michelle Sneed, a land subsidence specialist at the U.S. Geological Survey and coauthor on the paper. “The land sinking itself is not a problem. But if you’re on the coast, it’s a big problem. If you have infrastructure that crosses long areas, it’s a big problem. If you have deep wells, they’re collapsing because of subsidence. That’s a problem.” For subsidence to become a problem, you need two things: The right kind of land, and an over-exploited aquifer. Aquifers hold water in between bits of sand, gravel, or clay. When the amount of clay in an aquifer is particularly high, the grains arrange themselves like plates thrown haphazardly in a sink—they’ve basically got random orientations, and the water fills in the spaces between the grains. But if you start extracting water from an aquifer, those spaces collapse and the grains draw closer together. “Those plates rearrange themselves into more like a stack of dinner plates that you put in your cupboard,” says Sneed. “It takes a lot less space, obviously, to stack the plates that way. And so that’s the compaction of the aquifer system that then results in land subsidence at the surface.” But wouldn’t pumping more water back into the aquifer force the clay plates back to their random, spacey orientations? Unfortunately, no. “It’ll press those grains apart a little bit—you’ll get a little bit of expansion in the aquifer system represented as uplift on the land surface. But it’s a tiny amount,” says Sneed. We’re talking maybe three quarters of an inch of movement. “They’re still stacked like the plates in your cupboard,” she continues. So at this point you’ve got a double-barreled problem: The land has sunk and it won’t reinflate, and the aquifers won’t hold as much water as they once did, because they’ve compressed. “And that’s an important point,” says Sneed. “As places around the world, including California, are starting to use aquifer systems as managed reservoirs, the compaction of them prior to now has reduced their ability to store water.” As the growing human population and more intense droughts brought on by climate change are putting ever more stress on water supplies, land is subsiding all over the world. Some parts of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, for instance, are sinking as much as 10 inches a year, all while the seas are rising around it. Models estimate that in just three decades, 95 percent of North Jakarta could be underwater. The situation is so dire, Indonesia is planning to move its capital. But scientists haven’t modeled global risks of subsidence—until now. To build their model, Sneed and her colleagues scoured the existing literature on land subsidence in 200 locations worldwide. They considered those geological factors (high clay content), as well as topology, as subsidence is more likely to happen on flat land. They factored in population and economic growth, data on water use, and climate variables. The researchers found that, planet-wide, subsidence could threaten 4.6 million square miles of land in the next two decades. While that’s just 8 percent of Earth’s land, humanity tends to build big cities in coastal areas, which are prone to subsidence. So they estimate that, in the end, 1.6 billion people could be affected. The modeling further found that worldwide, subsidence exposes assets totaling a gross domestic product of $8.19 trillion, or 12 percent of global GDP.   Subsidence is uniquely sensitive to climate change—at least indirectly. On a warmer planet, droughts are longer and more intense. “This is very important,” says Herrera-García. “Because no matter the amount of annual rainfall you have, the most important issue is that you have a prolonged drought period.” Dry reservoirs will lead cities to pump even more water out of their aquifers, and once you collapse the structure of an aquifer by neatly stacking those plates of clay grains, there’s no going back. For the 1.6 billion people potentially affected by subsidence—and that’s just by the year 2040—the consequences could be dire, leading to both water shortages and the flooding of low-lying land. “It’s definitely very startling results,” says USGS coastal geologist Patrick Barnard, who studies subsidence but wasn’t involved in this new work. “Especially coastal megacities—most of the megacities are, in fact, coastal. So it really highlights the issue in relation to coastal flooding.” And urban populations are booming: According to the United Nations, nearly 70 percent of humans will live in cities by 2050, up from 50 percent currently. Humanity has tended to construct its cities where rivers empty into the sea, where the conditions for subsidence are ideal. Long ago, these rivers deposited sediments loaded with the clay, which humans then built upon. “The areas that are at high risk are in those kinds of settings near the outlets of river deltas, and where you have low-lying, flat sedimentary basins near coasts,” says University of California, Berkeley geophysicist Roland Burgmann, who studies subsidence but wasn’t involved in this new work. But you can actually find this problem inland, too, for instance in Mexico City, which is built on top of the sediments of a former lake, and is accordingly suffering from subsidence. Cities built on landfill are also sinking as that material settles. In the Bay Area megalopolis, for instance, some areas are sinking as much as a third of an inch a year. Modeling estimates from researchers at Arizona State University and UC Berkeley hold that by the end of the century, as much as 165 square miles of the Bay Area could be inundated as land sinks and the sea rises. Subsidence gets even trickier because its effects can vary dramatically over short distances, depending on factors like local clay composition or which side of an earthquake fault the land happens to be on. So this new global study is great for determining risk on a large scale, but scientists will still have to investigate subsidence with a finer focus. “This kind of model presented here lays the ground for identifying the areas that are at higher risk,” says Arizona State University geophysicist Manoochehr Shirzaei, who studies subsidence and peer reviewed the new paper. “And then we deploy monitoring tools and methods to come up with very high-resolution measurements.” To get this more localized data, researchers map a landscape using lasers fired from an aircraft, and combine that with information from satellites that shoot radar at the ground to determine how quickly it’s sinking. Really, the only way humanity will be able to stave off subsidence is to stop over-exploiting aquifers, a tall order on a rapidly warming planet. “Aquifers will be depleted, one way or another,” says Shirzaei. “It’s not possible to ask people who are in need of fresh water to stop using groundwater because it causes subsidence. So the bigger picture is: What are the adaptation strategies?” That could mean elevating buildings on lands that are subsiding and flooding. It could mean relying more on desalinating seawater, though that remains highly energy intensive, and therefore expensive. Or cities might follow in the footsteps of Los Angeles, which is modifying its streets to collect precious rainwater. At the end of the day, subsiding cities are up against unstoppable physical forces. “Geology is geology,” says Sneed. “We can’t do anything about that.”","From the California Delta to Jakarta, the World’s Aquifers Are Collapsing"

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Robin Lockman feared the worst for her town of Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the city’s treasurer, she estimated that it might lose up to 25 percent of its budget as tax revenues stalled and the prices of oil, gas and coal tanked, eliminating money the city typically receives from the state as royalties from the extractive energy industry. So the city did the hard work of laying off 18 employees and cutting funds for travel and training. And then a surprising thing happened: The huge deficit never arrived. In fact, over the summer, the city brought in more tax revenue than the year before. Between July and September, Cheyenne saw a 20.5 percent increase in tax revenue compared to 2019. In September alone, the increase was a staggering 83 percent, or $1.4 million. “I was in shock when I saw it,” said Lockman. She feared the good news was a mistake, so she called the Wyoming Department of Revenue to confirm the numbers. “The tax reported was legitimate, and was due to the Roundhouse Wind Project,” said Lockman, referring to an energy development west of the city. Throughout Wyoming, counties typically depend on industries like coal, oil and gas drilling, mining or tourism and recreation to bring in the taxes necessary to pay for education, community programs and infrastructure. Overall economic activity is down—statewide, sales and use taxes shrunk 6 percent over the last year—but revenues from mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction are down nearly twice that. Meanwhile, profits from wind energy developments, like the Roundhouse Wind Project, are booming. Now, residents and officials are asking whether wind energy can help the state survive the economic storm of the pandemic—and become a reliable revenue stream for the future as fossil fuel income dries up. Over the last decade, investors have laid the groundwork for wind farms across Wyoming, which ranks among the nation’s top 10 states for wind capacity, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The Power Company of Wyoming, a private company run by the Anschutz Corporation, is developing a facility on Carbon County’s 320,000-acre Overland Trail Ranch, just outside Rawlins. Framed by I-80 to the north and Sage Creek Road to the west, the property is one of Wyoming’s classic wide-open spaces: miles of rolling grassland dotted with scrubby sagebrush. On land long used for cattle and sheep ranching, in a county named for rich coal deposits, construction crews have built roads and turbine pads for the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project, which will comprise nearly 1,000 wind turbines by 2026. Sixty miles east, Rocky Mountain Power, a subsidiary of the state’s largest utility, has begun erecting 270-feet tall turbines at the Ekola Flats Wind Energy Project. The projects will create local jobs as workers operate and maintain the facilities. “Once the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project is complete, we estimate 114 permanent jobs will be created,” said Kara Choquette, Power Company of Wyoming’s communications director. The Two Rivers and Lucky Star wind projects, smaller developments near the border between Carbon and Albany counties, are expected to generate another 24 long-term operations and maintenance jobs. Right now, that new construction is generating much-needed sales taxes on materials. Between April and June, Carbon County’s taxable sales increased by 108 percent. “Everyone else around here’s hair is on fire, but we’re sitting in a pretty good position, thanks to wind energy,” said Dave Throgmorton, director of the Carbon County Higher Education Center, which is funded by the county and provides college-level and vocational training classes.  But that increased tax flow is not guaranteed to continue. Lockman, Cheyenne’s treasurer, thinks the boom her city saw in the third quarter of 2020 might be a one-time influx from a period of heavy construction. “Personally, I feel it’s probably a temporary type of situation, but I’m hoping it will be longer term,” she said.  Residents have also raised concerns that wind energy jobs aren’t going to locals. Many wind projects have been completed by teams that travel to the state for a few weeks at a time, living in camps at the edge of town, Throgmorton said. “Everyone was hoping locals would be involved in wind turbines, but turns out that’s all done by specialty teams from outside,” he said. For example, the permit applications for the Two Rivers and Lucky Star wind projects explicitly mention “man camps” and estimate that roughly 80 percent of workers will be “non-local.” About half of the 100 people working on the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre project between April and November were from Wyoming, said Choquette, the Power Company of Wyoming communications director. The wind industry faces other sources of resistance in Wyoming. Groups across wind-rich counties have opposed projects, saying turbines disrupt dark sky areas, impede views or decrease property values. In addition, legislators have proposed raising taxes on wind generation and removing tax incentives. While those changes could generate more tax revenue, they could also drive wind projects elsewhere. According to a 2019 analysis by Wyoming’s Center for Energy Economics and Public Policy, Wyoming already taxes wind developments at roughly twice the rate of neighboring Colorado. Though legislators have not made any recent changes to wind taxes, recurring proposals scare off companies, said Terry Weickum, a former Carbon County Commission chairman and a newly-elected member of the Rawlins City Council. “No one wants to do business in an unstable environment,” said Weickum. “It’d be like if you bought a car for $100, and then you found out this $100 car needs a $2,000 motor.”  Some see it as a sign that the state is giving up on its sunsetting oil, gas and mining industries. Throgmorton said many of his students imagine following in their parents’ footsteps and working at the Sinclair Oil Refinery. “But that’s more fantasy than real now,” he said. Still, many Wyomingites hope that renewable energies like wind will help sustain the state’s energy economy in the long-term. “Honestly, I hated (wind energy) when it first came along, but I realized I didn’t know anything about it,” said Weickum. “People who have made their living in oil, gas and coal—they feel like if you like wind, you’re cheating on your wife, you’re cheating on oil, gas and coal. But we need every piece of it.” Even if the wind industry doesn’t continue generating hefty tax revenues, its contributions could help keep counties in the black. Companies pay sales tax on equipment purchased for maintenance, like replacement turbine blades, property taxes on the assessed value of projects, and taxes on the energy generated. According to Connie Wilbert, director of the Sierra Club’s Wyoming chapter, those proceeds can be many millions of dollars a year. “For these small towns in Wyoming, budgets aren’t that big, so if you had a steady, reliable $5 million a year, that’s a big deal.”  People in communities benefitting from the financial windfall of new projects are grateful for those extra dollars this year. Throgmorton calls the wind industry “the goose that’s laying the golden egg,” and said he’s relieved to be able to focus on his campus’s development. And Lockman, the Cheyenne treasurer, said that even if the big tax increases from this year don’t continue, it’s been a boon during the pandemic months that will allow the city some leeway in 2021. “Thank goodness for wind energy,” she said, “because if not for it, we’d be in a lot different shape.” ","When the Pandemic Gutted Oil Revenues, Wind Power Rescued Wyoming’s Capital City"
287,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/01/fighting-climate-change-could-define-kamala-harris-vice-presidency-watch-our-interview-with-her/,MJ,Far Left,"MSNBC, Zuma Kamala Harris represents a series of historic firsts—she will be the first woman vice president, the first Black vice president, and the first Asian American vice president. She’ll also be the first-ever vice president who has devised a comprehensive plan to address climate change—and as the tie-breaking vote in the evenly split Senate, she’ll have plenty of opportunity to fight for the environment.  Harris’ home state of California has been hammered by longer wildfire seasons, blackouts from extreme heat, and drought. Harris doesn’t shy away from connecting these events to manmade climate change. When I sat down with her in Dubuque, Iowa, a year before she joined the presidential ticket, she was still in the midst of her own presidential campaign. “For me this issue of the climate crisis relates to every aspect of what we do,” she said. In 2019, Mother Jones' @rebleber sat down with @KamalaHarris when she was on the presidential campaign trail to talk about tackling the climate crisis. ""We need to do a lot,"" Harris said. ""And we can. It's achievable.""  https://t.co/2Ejcg213S4 pic.twitter.com/trA1O80vvU — Mother Jones (@MotherJones) January 19, 2021  Her remarks to me in October 2019 captured some of the themes that are starting to define the Biden administration’s all-hands-on-deck approach to the climate crisis: It’s not something the Environmental Protection Agency can address alone. “Every branch has a role in this responsibility.”  The Biden administration will need an all-hands-on-deck approach to the climate crisis. “For me this issue of the climate crisis relates to every aspect of what we do,” Kamala Harris told us in 2019. “Every branch has a role.” https://t.co/2Ejcg213S4 pic.twitter.com/4ol5ORseub — Mother Jones (@MotherJones) January 19, 2021  Harris’ climate plan didn’t get much attention during her presidential run, but it was impressive: Her vision of the Green New Deal included a staggering economic investment in clean energy and infrastructure. She spoke about the importance of including low-income and communities of color in the fight against pollution and climate change; her Climate Equity Act, introduced first in 2019 with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) in 2019, requires that any environmental legislation receive an equity score to assess its impact on frontline communities. As the tie-breaking vote in the Senate, Kamala Harris can use her vice presidency to hold polluters accountable. In 2019 she pledged: “Let’s get them not only in the pocket book, but let’s make sure there are serious penalties for their behaviors.” https://t.co/2Ejcg213S4 pic.twitter.com/t99kvgpaHZ — Mother Jones (@MotherJones) January 19, 2021  Another theme from my interview with Harris was her insistence that the Department of Justice should investigate and rein in manipulative oil and gas industry practices. Her actual record on that is more mixed: As California attorney general, Harris led an investigation into whether ExxonMobil misled consumers about climate change, but she did not go as far as to issue subpoenas. And although she has at times embellished her history of suing and winning against Big Oil, she has spoken forcefully about holding polluters accountable. “Let’s get them not only in the pocket book, but let’s make sure there are serious penalties for their behaviors,” she said. That means taking aim at the “whole apparatus built around them” that’s built to protect the dominance of fossil fuels. And, she emphasized, that may not just mean the major oil companies, but other players, like gas-reliant utilities. “I think everyone who is part of misinforming the public, misleading the public and false advertising should be held accountable,” she said. “I think everyone who is part of misinforming the public, misleading the public and false advertising should be held accountable.” —@KamalaHarris on the climate crisis pic.twitter.com/E5dBtJme7H — Mother Jones (@MotherJones) January 19, 2021 ",Fighting Climate Change Could Define Kamala Harris’ Vice Presidency.

It was co-published in partnership with Mother Jones, The Arizona Republic, and Orlando Sentinel. Regional stories based on the heat illness data analysis produced by CJI can be found in Orlando Sentinel and The Arizona Republic. Mario Wilcox won’t set out in the summer without an emergency kit in his car trunk: a cooler with an ice pack and a blanket. He learned this improvised life saver from his time in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars; ice and a wet cloth can cool down an overheated body. Now he finds it vital in the intensifying heat of Fort Pierce, Florida, and especially his heat-stressed neighborhood. More than 2,000 miles away in Phoenix, Arizona, Grace Salinas monitors the street outside her window in a public housing complex when summer temperatures reach triple digits. A community leader in the area southwest of downtown, Salinas stocks cold water bottles for anyone she sees struggling with the heat, a situation growing more common each year.  Sgt. Mario Victorez Wilcox takes a break after volunteering at a community food giveaway, Friday, Nov. 20, 2020, in Fort Pierce, Fla.  Phelan M. Ebenhack Heat-related illnesses are soaring in Arizona and Florida as the planet warms and temperatures rise. Among the hottest states in the country, none saw a sharper spike in summertime temperatures over the last century than these two. Already, Arizona is considered the hottest state in the US, and Phoenix the hottest city, with more than 140 days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit last year alone. In Florida, the combination of heat and humidity makes it one of the nation’s most dangerous places, according to a recent study. Poor communities are bearing the brunt of sickening heat in these states, an analysis by Columbia Journalism Investigations and the Center for Public Integrity found. Federal data capturing most emergency room visits and hospitalizations in Arizona and Florida reveal higher rates of heat-related illnesses in areas with less income. The data, never before made public at the zip code level, also show that the highest rates of heat-related illnesses are in neighborhoods with a history of racial segregation. Experts say racist policies of the past created conditions, never corrected, that make heat more dangerous for people there today. Winter has arrived in Arizona and Florida, attracting northerners eager to escape the cold. It seems easy to forget scorching temperatures now. But the warming planet will continue to make summers hotter and more deadly. And that means the problem requires attention year round. “You would never decide not to heat your home because it is only useful in the winter,” said Howard Frumkin of the University of Washington School of Public Health, who headed the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s climate program in the mid-2000s. Likewise, the best solutions for extreme heat—planting more trees, creating buddy systems—must be implemented consistently to be effective. If “efforts lag for months at a time,” he said, “then you lose ground.” The response to the problem in these hotspots is as disparate as the landscape itself. In the desert city of Phoenix, grassroots groups are partnering with government officials to protect low-income Black and Latino residents from the scorching sun, but targeted and long-term solutions have yet to come. In the beachfront city of Fort Pierce, by contrast, local authorities barely recognize the threat of heat and are doing little to nothing about it.  Adrienne Hollis, a researcher at the Union of Concerned Scientists, studies the effects of the changing climate on the health of historically disadvantaged populations. She notes that communities of color are often the hardest hit by extreme heat. According to her calculations, US counties where African Americans or Latinos represent at least a quarter of the population—most in the South—have faced more days with temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit over a three-decade period: an average of 18 and 13 days per year, respectively, as compared with roughly seven days a year for the rest of the country.  “Zip codes do determine your health,” Hollis said, “and most of that is because of structural racism.”    Arizona’s 85007 zip code, which includes both the predominantly low-income Black and Latino area southwest of downtown and the more affluent, white neighborhood of Encanto Park, had in 2017 the highest rate of heat-related illness in that state. CJI’s analysis of the federal data shows per-capita ER visits and hospitalizations linked to problems such as heat stroke, heat exhaustion and dehydration in this 4.5-square-mile area were nearly 10 times the state’s average. In Florida’s 34950 zip code, the majority Black and low-income neighborhood of Lincoln Park where Wilcox lives, residents came to hospitals for these ailments nearly six times more often than the statewide average. The situation in both places has been getting worse, county health data shows. In and around southwest of downtown Phoenix, the yearly number of heat-related ER visits for every 100,000 people has more than doubled since 2010, to 129. In Saint Lucie County, where Lincoln Park is located, the rate of such visits in recent years is almost double its mid-2000s level, while hospitalization rates in the same period have more than tripled.  A home southwest of downtown Phoenix, where fewer trees, shadeless bus stops and a lack of financial resources makes heat more dangerous.  Nick Oza / The Arizona Republic Emergency calls to 911 in both places reveal the risks faced by residents during the summer and even well into the fall. Elderly people, overcome by heat, collapsed and injured themselves while walking outside. Heat exhaustion hit young adults as they biked or waited for a bus. Potentially deadly heat strokes snuck up on workers laboring in the sun. Salinas, 70, who grew up in Phoenix’s 85007 zip code, is used to seeing people succumb to the baking sun. She lost a cousin who lived in the neighborhood to heat stroke and witnessed her adult son, sprawled on the ground outside her home, go to the ER for the same reason. She knows how to identify the danger signs. “We see people walking by looking like they need to breathe,” she said. “If you’re not sweating anymore, you’re already in trouble.” During the summer, the tenant leader also checks on elderly people living in her public-housing complex, built in the 1940s to house Mexican Americans. She gives people tips on using the air conditioner in more economical ways.  That may sound like a constant battle. And it is.  “It’s just the way of life here,” Salinas said. What’s driving this problem is inequality. Salinas lives in an area largely populated by squat houses with dusty yards that rivals the hottest spots in Phoenix. Daytime temperatures here can be between four and seven degrees Fahrenheit higher than in the wealthier Encanto, located partly in the 85007 zip code just three miles north, according to separate experiments conducted by Arizona State University and the Arizona Republic.  While Encanto is an oasis full of parks, replete with trees that keep the air cooler, the area southwest of downtown, between West Harrison Street and the Maricopa Freeway, is marked by barren lots and heat-trapping cement. Mirage-like desert mountains on the horizon break up the urban landscape of highways, buildings and fences here. To make things worse, this area is one of the poorest in town, with residents who often can’t afford to run an air conditioner. Electricity bills can cost around $600 a month per family. It’s a dangerous combination. “That’s where the inequities show,” said Juan Barreto-Declet, a geographer researching environmental vulnerability to heat in Phoenix. “That is where the vulnerability is higher.” And those inequities appear to be widening. State health data shows heat illnesses in this neighborhood and across central Phoenix have increased at a rate seven times the rest of the city since 2010. In Encanto, by contrast, the annual rate of heat illnesses has dipped.   CJI’s analysis shows 79 people who live in the 85007 zip code went to the hospital in 2017 because of life-threatening symptoms brought on by heat. Around half suffered from heat exhaustion, while another 20 percent succumbed to the more severe condition of heat stroke. The risks facing residents in this area didn’t happen by chance. Investments here—in trees, parks, transit—have been historically lower than in higher-income areas of the city.  That history dates back at least as far as government-imposed “redlining” of the 1930s. The federal Home Owners’ Loan Corp. mapped neighborhoods in cities across the country and graded them according to perceived risk of lending there—with race as the key factor. Areas with people of color and immigrants were marked in red and judged high-risk for mortgage lenders, starving neighborhoods of investment.  The government’s red pen came for the south and west sides of Phoenix, among the city’s oldest regions and historically inhabited by Blacks, Mexican immigrants and Native Americans. Local decisions reinforced residential segregation: Zoning regulations forbade industrial land use in white neighborhoods, funneling that development and its pollution to places where people of color lived; race-restrictive covenants prevented anyone who wasn’t white from buying houses in affluent suburbs.  These policies resulted in “relegating minorities and low-income populations to the hottest areas of the city,” Barreto-Declet said. A similar storyline has unfolded in many other places across the country — including Florida’s heat-illnesses hotspot, Lincoln Park in Fort Pierce.  The area’s first Black people were enslaved, brought by white settlers on the hunt for land along the Atlantic Coast in 1842. More African Americans moved to the region after the Civil War to work on pineapple farms and then railroads.  The Jim Crow era hardened this segregation. Lincoln Park residents couldn’t go to the same school or beach as white people. Celebrated writer Zora Neale Hurston, who spent her last years in the neighborhood, was buried in an all-Black cemetery, her grave unmarked for a dozen years. The now-shuttered African American-owned theater — one of just four in the country — stands on the main thoroughfare here, Avenue D. U.S. 1 was the literal dividing line: the “Colored Town” on one side, and on the other, the “White City.”  “Segregation in the county determined where a Black citizen could live, work, go to school, fish, eat, give birth, go to church, pee, walk and be buried,” said Jean Ellen Wilson, an 80-year-old historian who grew up in the white part of town. “Black people were not allowed to come out to White City.” Block homes are viewed in the Lincoln Park neighborhood, Friday, Nov. 20, 2020, in Fort Pierce, Fla. Phelan M. Ebenhack Today, most of the city’s Black residents still live in Lincoln Park, which remains “Fort Pierce’s most segregated community,” a 2016 city housing report states. The neighborhood is 91 percent African American, and a little more than half the residents live below the federal poverty line. In a county where the typical household makes about $43,000, the median income here is just $15,797. One aid agency fields 300 or so monthly requests from local residents seeking help to pay their electricity bills.  Wilcox sees the stark difference between his neighborhood and the rest of the city when driving in the area. Heading south on Indian River Drive, toward the Fort Pierce immortalized in paintings of exuberant sunrises and palm-lined beaches, he takes in solar panels, fountains, expensive houses. On the return trip north, he spots weathered homes and stores, their pastel colors faded, their windows boarded or covered in aluminum foil — a sign of no air conditioning or insulation. On a hot day, families keep doors open and sit outside to cool off. Friends play dominoes or catch ball on street corners. As he sees it, a systematic lack of resources explains why people here are sickened by heat.  “The south and the beachfront are the haves,” he said. “And the north of the city is the haves not.”  CJI’s data analysis shows that 33 people living in the zip code encompassing most of Lincoln Park went to the hospital for heat-related illnesses in 2017. Sixty percent were Black. That’s a lot of people for a small area of about 16,000 residents.  The legacy of racist policies on present-day heat vulnerability is widespread across the country. A study conducted by researchers at the Science Museum of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University and Portland State University looked at more than 108 cities to conclude that the hottest neighborhoods are those located in formerly redlined areas. Unpublished data from this research, calculated exclusively for CJI, shows that in Phoenix, for example, the current difference in temperature between redlined areas and other neighborhoods is more than eight degrees Fahrenheit during the summer.  In the city’s 85007 zip code, home to several shelters, people identified as homeless account for some of the patients sickened by heat. But even when this population is excluded from the data, the zip code remains the state’s hardest hit. And Black people are disproportionately represented among the heat-illness patients, CJI’s analysis shows: They’re three times more likely to go to the ER for that reason.  CJI analyzed statewide data in Arizona and Florida to see whether the zip codes with the highest heat-illness rates were also the hottest, but the results were inconclusive. Heat maps show Fort Pierce’s Lincoln Park and neighborhoods southwest of downtown Phoenix have elevated temperatures, but other similarly hot areas have experienced fewer heat illnesses. That suggests temperature isn’t the only reason so many people are sickened by heat in these neighborhoods. Underlying health conditions that exacerbate heat illness may play a role. In both zips, CJI’s analysis of hospital data found high numbers of patients diagnosed with conditions known to heighten risk for heat stress — diabetes, hypertension, heart disease. In Lincoln Park, nearly half of the 2017 heat-illness patients were also diagnosed with diabetes or hypertension. This too can be a consequence of decades of decisions that sapped neighborhood resources.  One 2017 community assessment found the diabetes rate is three times higher in Lincoln Park than in the rest of the county, a spike that its health department has worked to reduce. Most health experts recognize the link between poverty, chronic conditions and heat, but it doesn’t seem to be on county health officials’ radar. Clint Sperber, who heads the Saint Lucie County Department of Health, declined to be interviewed for this article. In an email, he acknowledged that the agency wasn’t aware of the heat issue until a CJI reporter reached out. The agency had no answer about why it had not already made use of the data on heat illnesses that the Florida Department of Health collects so its county counterparts can develop public health interventions.   “The Department of Health in St. Lucie and our community partners have been informed, and as a community we will collaborate to address this issue,” Sperber wrote in a November 12 email. The agency has taken the problem to the Fort Pierce city manager, he said. A spokesperson for that official, Nick Mimms, said in an email that the city is “looking forward…to collect as much data and information as possible in order to combat the heat illness and create a program that provides safety and protects the well-being of its citizens.” Mimms declined an interview request. Gerald Newberry, 59, was born and raised in Lincoln Park and has always worked outdoors, starting as a teenager when he picked fruit with his father. He lost count of how many times he saw co-workers getting sick in the fields because of the baking sun. On the job, farmworkers with limited access to health care relied on a homemade treatment to beat the heat: a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar mixed with water. Now a landscaper, Newberry still carries a vinegar and water bottle with him. Often, he gets dizzy and feels ill under the sun.  “It feels like you did bump your head, it feels sore, and you know that you didn’t bump it,” he said. “And then another thing is the headaches, heavy headaches.”  He has never fainted but fears the day he will, like the locals say, be “bear-caught,” a heat stroke that takes you to the ground like a bear sneaking in from behind. Until he recently got health insurance, sporadic visits to Walgreens to check his blood pressure were his only form of health care.  Cities can mitigate heat risk with steps such as planting trees, investing in new designs and cool materials, and opening cooling centers for residents without air conditioning. None of this has happened in Fort Pierce, the health department said. In one of the city’s few nods to the dangers, it prohibits residents from leaving dogs outside when the heat index is above 100°F. There’s no local law protecting people from heat. A 2016 report from the county emergency-management division at the Department of Public Safety warned that the “probability of heat indexes within the range of causing health problems is moderate to high during the summer months.” But according to the division, the county has never declared a heat emergency and, unlike hurricanes and floods, the issue is not among its priorities.  County health officials also confirm that they don’t have any programs or policies for extreme heat. In a 2015 report, the Florida health department classified Fort Pierce’s county, Saint Lucie, at medium to high risk for heat hazards under different climate change scenarios. But the state’s actions to prevent heat illnesses are scant. Its “Beat the Heat” campaign is a 26-second video with tips for residents about how to stay safe. State health officials have long overlooked climate-related health hazards. In 2016, the department shunted its federally funded climate and health program to Florida State University, where it has no policy-making power. The program serves three of the state’s 67 counties. Saint Lucie isn’t one of them. Former Fort Pierce City Commissioner Reginald Sessions, a native of Lincoln Park who represented the area until December, said he’d like to see more effort by health officials to help Black and poor communities.  “We need to put a lot more emphasis on targeting them to improve their health,” he said. “I assure you that if we do that, we will have less African Americans suffering from heat strokes.” In Phoenix, where local officials are keenly aware of heat’s dangers, efforts to protect residents are further along. But plans to address the long underinvestment in neighborhoods southwest of downtown have yet to bear fruit.   Efforts to save lives with heat-risk awareness campaigns date back to the summer of 2009, after eight local residents died of heat stroke.  Eva Olivas with the grassroots Phoenix Revitalization Corp. reached out to the city parks and aquatics departments. They organized information sessions at public pools and posted on social media.  “Sometimes people who live here get so used to the heat that they forget how dangerous it can be,” she said. “The idea was to remind them that the summers today are not like summers before.” Mark Hartman, who heads the city’s Sustainability Office, said Phoenix is trying to be the first municipality to respond to extreme heat like other places prepare for storms. In 2018, he and other city officials launched a “Heat Ready” program that pulled together actions they had already adopted and plan to extend, including emergency relief such as cooling centers and long-term initiatives, like planting trees and using “cooling pavement” that doesn’t absorb as much heat. His office is testing this pavement in different districts across the city, including one location outside the 85007 zip code in the area southwest of downtown. Phoenix has set a goal to cover 25 percent of its land area with trees by 2030. That would double the tree canopy and require planting 10,000 trees per year on average. But the city is off track: When Phoenix planted a record number of trees in 2019, it still amounted to less than half the annual requirement.  A CJI analysis of satellite data reveals a stark disparity in green space in zip code 85007: Forty-two percent of the wealthier Encanto neighborhood has leafy vegetation, including two golf courses. By contrast, just seven percent of the area southwest of downtown Phoenix is green. Residents have pushed city officials for years to plant more trees in vulnerable areas, and a city subcommittee recommended the appointment of a “tree administrator.”  City officials have yet to implement that recommendation. Hartman said the city is trying to map the areas most in danger from heat to target tree distribution and related actions.  “We originally thought that we needed to create shades throughout our whole city and trees everywhere, but actually, we just need them in certain places, like in vulnerable communities,” he said.  In the last three years, his cabinet has worked with researchers like David Hondula, a sustainability scientist at ASU and a member of the state’s climate and health team, to develop a more complete vulnerability index. It aims to take into account not only where the most heat-vulnerable people live, but also where they are most exposed.  “The traditional approaches to vulnerability don’t really reflect how people move around the city,” said Hondula, whose own research has identified zip code 85007 among the city’s top 10 neighborhoods most vulnerable to heat.  Advocates, scientists and county health officials have met multiple times with residents of Edison-Eastlake, a neighborhood just east of downtown Phoenix, to hear about problems contributing to heat risk. Among those they named: too few street trees and unshaded bus stops.  This shouldn’t come as news to city officials. A 2004 Phoenix urban design plan recommended the city “provide comfortable and convenient shaded bus stops.” But from her office window today, 16 years later, Olivas sees a bus stop that’s merely a sign in the sun. “Should this kind of ‘infrastructure’ be considered normal in a city where the temperatures get up to 117?” she asks. That’s just one such example of a missed opportunity. In 2014, the city launched a streets plan that included guidelines for developers on shade and tree coverage. Four years later, seven of the project’s nine advisory board members quit, saying the city, lobbied by developers, was proposing a series of alterations to the street design guidelines that “watered them down” until they were meaningless. The project stalled. “The city is really good at writing press releases and approving plans,” said Stacey Champion, who participated in a 2018 petition to Phoenix officials about local trees, “but not so good in making sure those plans actually get followed.” Hartman, acknowledging some problems, blamed a lack of funding and personnel. He said the city still “has a long way” to go to be heat ready.  Mayor Kate Gallego, asked about criticism that the city has prioritized plans over action, declined to comment. Her office pointed to yet another plan: a climate-action strategy it’s developing after joining a network of 96 municipalities worldwide whose leaders have committed to combat global warming. It will include heat mitigation. “Phoenix is uniquely experienced to share proven practices for building heat resilience,” Gallego said​ in a written statement. “We are still learning and have a lot of work to do, but our partnership with heat research powerhouse Arizona State University and our legacy of living with heat makes Phoenix a model for other cities who are grappling with this public health challenge.” If officials don’t counteract the longstanding disinvestment that endangers people in communities like Lincoln Park and those southwest of downtown Phoenix, heat risks there will worsen. A report from the Union of Concerned Scientists predicts Florida will experience some of the most frequent periods of extreme heat in the nation by 2050 as climate change intensifies: as many as 105 days a year with a heat index over 100°F. The group expects Fort Pierce and the surrounding county will endure five times more extreme heat days a year than from the 1970s to 2000. In the greater Phoenix area, such days are projected to double. The UCS’s Hollis, who grew up in hot and segregated Mobile, Alabama, warns that people of color will bear the brunt of this change. By midcentury, if nothing is done to stop climate change, counties where Black residents make up more than a quarter of the population will experience an additional month of extreme heat days each year compared with their counterparts, according to an analysis she conducted.       “If nothing is done,” she said, “we’re gonna have more health disparities, more people sick and more deaths.” Back in Phoenix, Grace Salinas has tried to keep up her usual heat outreach. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, her block watch association had to abandon its plans for awareness campaigns and other activities. She sent information leaflets to neighbors instead.  The number of 911 heat-related calls in the city last year topped 1,400. In the last six years, those calls have jumped 80 percent.

289,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/01/biden-needs-to-hit-the-ground-running-on-climate-or-else/,MJ,Far Left,"acilo/Getty This story was originally published by Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. First, Americans, let’s congratulate ourselves for having used the power of our vote to create an opportunity for meaningful progress on climate going forward. Joe Biden’s victory in the recent presidential race ushers in a new era of domestic progress and global cooperation. It allows us to begin to repair some of the damage that was done by Donald Trump’s presidency during the past four years—damage inflicted both to our own efforts to address the climate crisis and to our reputation on the world stage. But make no mistake. As a climate scientist, I know all too well that we are running out of time to avert climate catastrophe. In fact, we’ve already run out of time. It’s too late to protect everyone. From “zombie storms” in superheated oceans to wildfires so widespread and intense that they’re creating “smoke waves” that blanket the country, befoul the air and endanger public health, to an unprecedented Atlantic hurricane season that can be tied to a bathtub-warm tropical Atlantic, the past year alone has provided ample evidence that climate change is now an ongoing, rolling threat from one place to another. The carbon we either do or don’t choose to emit could shape not only the climate threats we must contend with in the decades ahead, but those that loom over the next 10,000 years. At this point it’s a matter now of limiting, rather than preventing, the damage. The sobering reality is that even if every country meets their currently stated commitments under the Paris Agreement (and many, including the United States and the European Union, are falling at least a bit short at this point), that gets us less than halfway to where we need to be—i.e., on a path to limiting average global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, or about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. We need to keep warming below that level if we want to avoid some of the worst—and in some cases irreversible—impacts. Better yet, we should aim for the more stringent 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.6 degrees Fahrenheit) that many are now calling for. While the Paris Agreement is a good starting point, we need to go well beyond existing Paris commitments now to achieve the reductions that are necessary: more than 7.5 percent per year globally for the next decade. In the last four years, under Donald Trump, the power of the federal government to protect the public has been handed over to the very polluters these agencies were built to regulate. Scientific expertise has been trampled by political (in)correctness over things as silly as “Sharpiegate” and as serious as COVID-19. With hundreds of thousands dead from coronavirus, we’ve sadly seen just how deadly it can be when political leaders hide or distort the evidence for political and ideological reasons. One mitigating factor is that over the last four years, many people and organizations found ways to work around a president who refused to lead, with state and other local governments stepping up to fill the void. Add all the action up, across all the ambitious states, cities, businesses, and others, and we can deliver up to a 37 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 2005 levels by 2030. Already, a third of all Americans live in a jurisdiction that’s made a commitment to 100 percent clean energy. And the good news is that there is much that President-Elect Biden can do almost immediately once in office. As former President Obama demonstrated, the president can use diplomacy to negotiate powerful international agreements such as the Paris Agreement, issue executive actions to insure higher vehicle fuel efficiency standards, tighten regulations on polluters, and block  massive additional fossil fuel infrastructure—such as the Keystone XL pipeline). Biden has a clear mandate generally (he is only the fourth challenger in 100 years to defeat an incumbent president seeking a second elected term) and on climate change specifically (which he made central to his campaign). The transition is likely to be abrupt and perilous however. While he can rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one—sending a critical signal to other countries that the United States. is ready to once again lead on climate—that’s just the start. He will not only need to quickly staff up with experts, but also ferret out Trump’s numerous swampy former appointees who have burrowed into the various agencies and administrations. And there’s only so much that a piecemeal approach can do to address such a massive structural problem, particularly when—as we saw under Trump—much of the progress made by a previous administration can be undone in a matter of years. That’s why comprehensive climate policy should be a top priority in the first 100 days of a prospective Biden administration. President-Elect Biden must use his decades of experience as a legislator to build the political consensus necessary, and then usher comprehensive climate action through Congress. Biden has put forward a bold climate plan with ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions and support for both regulatory and market-driven policy measures, as have Senate and House Democrats. There is real opportunity for meaningful climate legislation, but it will require some degree of compromise. The precise makeup—and even control—of the Senate is currently unknown; two runoff elections in Georgia scheduled in January will determine whether the Senate is under Republican or Democratic control. Even with Democratic control of the Senate combined with elimination of the filibuster—which has proven the bane of congressional climate policy—some degree of political compromise will be necessary. Some conservative Democrats, for example, are unlikely to support anything like the currently proposed Green New Deal. When my upcoming book on climate change went to press this summer, the publisher asked me to hazard a guess as to where we’d likely be at this point. I’m pleased to say that the text anticipated things pretty well: Given an even modestly favorable shift in political winds, one could envision [a bold climate bill] passing the House and moving on to the Senate with a half-dozen or more moderate conservatives crossing the aisle, joining with Senate Democrats to pass the bill within the next year or two… The president, in short, will have to win over potential allies in the middle, yet remain unafraid to play hardball with the Congress people who are captured by the fossil fuel industry. That, really, is what we need: A president who can unite us and who can lead us forward, together to tackle the great challenges we face. In the first 100 days he can help solve a crisis that would otherwise afflict us for the next 10,000 years. ",Biden Needs to Hit the Ground Running on Climate—or Else
290,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/01/our-laundry-is-fouling-arctic-seawater-with-microplastics/,MJ,Far Left,"Icebergs in the Arctic Ocean in Greenland.Explora_2005/Getty This story was originally published by The Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. The Arctic is “pervasively” polluted by microplastic fibers that most likely come from the washing of synthetic clothes by people in Europe and North America, research has found. The most comprehensive study to date found the microplastics in 96 of 97 sea water samples taken from across the polar region. More than 92 percent of the microplastics were fibers, and 73 percent of these were made of polyester and were the same width and colors as those used in clothes. Most of the samples were taken from 3-8 meters below the surface, where much marine life feeds. Other recent analysis estimated that 3,500 trillion plastic microfibers from clothes washing in the US and Canada ended up in the sea each year, while modeling suggested plastic dumped in the seas around the UK was carried to the Arctic within two years. The researchers found plastic fibers at the North Pole. With plastic recently discovered at the deepest point on Earth, the Mariana Trench, and the peak of Mount Everest, it is clear humanity’s litter has polluted the entire planet. It is known to injure wildlife that mistake it for food. People also consume microplastics via food and water, and breathe them in, although the health impact is not yet known. Much more water flows into the Arctic from the Atlantic than the Pacific, and the new research found higher concentrations of the microplastic fibers nearer the Atlantic, as well as longer and less degraded fibers. “We’re looking at a dominance of Atlantic inputs, which means sources of textile fibers in the North Atlantic from Europe and North America are likely to be driving the contamination in the Arctic Ocean,” said Peter Ross, at Ocean Wise Conservation Association in Canada, who led the study. “With these polyester fibers, we’ve essentially created a cloud throughout the world’s oceans.” “The Arctic is, yet again, at the receiving end of pollutants from the south,” he said. Toxic chemical pollutants including mercury and PCBs are well known at the pole. “It’s certainly cause for concern, when we realize that the Inuit people rely very heavily on aquatic foods.” The 3- to 8-meter layer of sea water is “a biologically important area where we find phytoplankton, zooplankton, small fish, big fish, seabirds and marine mammals, foraging looking for food”, said Ross. Large animals such as turtles, albatross, seals and whales are known to be killed by plastic and he said there was no reason to think it was different for the smaller ones. The research is published in the journal Nature Communications, and took 71 near-surface samples stretching from Norway to the north pole and then into the Canadian High Arctic. Another 26 samples were taken at depths down to 1,000m in the Beaufort Sea, to the north of Alaska. “A dominance of polyester was evident throughout the water column, highlighting the pervasive spread of synthetic fibers throughout the waters of the Arctic Ocean,” the researchers concluded. They found an average of 40 microplastic particles per cubic meter of water. The researchers said the type of plastic found at different depths in the oceans would depend on the density of the plastic, with buoyant polystyrene likely to float and dense PVC more likely to sink to the ocean floor. Polyester is closer to neutral buoyancy. Only a small proportion of the fibers found are thought to be from fishing gear, which use different plastics. It is possible that some of the fibers were carried to the Arctic by winds. “It is impressive how many samples they were able to take from such inhospitable places,” said Erik van Sebille, at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. “The results show again plastic is now omnipresent. The question should perhaps become ‘where don’t we find plastic yet?’” “Plastic anywhere in the environment is an atrocity, but in the Arctic it’s probably more harmful than in most other places,” he said. “That’s because it comes on top of the dramatic and dangerous climate change that the region and its ecosystems are experiencing. Pollution could be the proverbial drop that tips the bucket, as we say in Dutch.” Ross said individuals, clothes manufacturers, wastewater treatment companies and governments could all help stem the flow of microplastics into the Arctic: “We all have a role to play. It’s not about blaming textiles, or blaming the petrochemical complex. It’s about everybody acknowledging that this is not something that we want to see in the world’s oceans.” Van Sebille said: “We could hardly go out and about without clothes, could we? But we should think about better textiles.”",Our Laundry Is Fouling Arctic Seawater With Microplastics
291,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/01/amy-coney-barrett-set-to-hear-case-against-shell-her-dads-employer-for-29-years/,MJ,Far Left,"Chris Kleponis/CNP via ZUMA Wire) This story was originally published by HuffPost and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. Amy Coney Barrett was about 6 years old when her father, Michael Coney, began his 29-year career as one of Royal Dutch Shell’s top attorneys. She was 16 in 1988 when the oil giant’s own scientists prepared a confidential internal memo stating: “The main cause of increasing CO2 concentrations is considered to be fossil fuel burning.”  On Tuesday, the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in the city of Baltimore’s lawsuit against Shell, BP and several other oil companies demanding damages for the effects of climate change. And it’s unclear whether Barrett, the newest justice on the high court’s bench, will recuse herself from the case.  Justice Samuel Alito, who owns stock in several oil and gas companies, has already recused himself, documents filed with the court show. As of Thursday evening, nothing indicated that Barrett planned to do the same.  Cases involving Shell raised obvious conflicts of interest for the judge in the past. A recusal list Barrett submitted as part of her job on the bench of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit listed Shell seven times.  “My father worked at Shell Oil Company for many years, and while on the Seventh Circuit, in an abundance of caution, I have recused myself from cases involving those Shell entities with which he was involved,” she wrote in an answer to a questionnaire during her Senate confirmation hearings in October on her Supreme Court nomination by President Donald Trump.  Legal experts said Barrett’s father, who now works as a Catholic deacon in Louisiana, could be called for deposition as part of the case. He oversaw legal issues for Shell’s offshore drilling arm. The 91-page memo collating what Shell’s scientists knew about climate change in the late 1980s included the impact of warming on the company’s “offshore installations, coastal facilities and operation,” issues well within the elder Coney’s purview.  “Her dad’s role in maximizing Shell’s net revenue from drilling grew even as Shell’s internal documents show it knew burning carbon was changing our climate and he even sought tax benefits from its efforts to adapt its drilling platforms to survive sea level rise and bigger storms resulting from climate change,” said Lisa Graves, executive director of the research company True North Research and a former chief counsel for nominations on the Senate Judiciary Committee. An activist sprays graffiti on the entrance to the UK offices of Royal Dutch Shell. TOLGA AKMEN/AFP via Getty Images. The connections Barrett’s father has to Shell aren’t the only potential conflict of interest he poses for her in this case. He spent more than 20 years as an “active member of The American Petroleum Institute Subcommittee of Exploration and Production Law” and twice served as its chairman, according to a biography on his former law firm’s website. API, the nation’s largest and most influential oil and gas lobby, filed an amicus brief supporting the oil companies in the Baltimore case.   “It is entirely possible that Justice Barrett’s father could be a witness at a later point in this case,” said Marco Simons, the general counsel at the environmental legal nonprofit EarthRights International. “It sure creates a very problematic appearance that she is very close to the facts of this case, and in most cases that would lead a judge to recuse.” The Baltimore case is one of the most closely watched attempts by a city or state to force companies that spent decades funding misinformation on climate science that internal documents show their own researchers understood to pay for the destruction unchecked warming caused. Maryland’s largest city, which has been suffering extended heat waves and coastal flooding as a result of warming that’s already underway, has asked the Supreme Court to refer its lawsuit seeking damages back to a state court. Lawyers representing the oil giants named in the litigation want the high court to keep the case in federal court, where they expect to more easily fend off the allegations.  Barrett’s own views on climate science remain opaque. During her contentious confirmation hearings last fall, she repeatedly said she was “not a scientist” and therefore did “not have firm views” on warming. She called the issue “a very contentious matter of public debate” and “politically controversial.”  The vague statements, to many, appeared to grant legitimacy to the climate change denial her father’s employers deliberately drummed up to obscure a scientific reality their own researchers understood would upend the oil industry’s business model.  “Baltimore City is already feeling the impacts of climate change in severe storms and flooding, sewage backups and overflows, heatwaves, and polluted air,” said Nabeehah Azeez, an organizer with the Baltimore Peoples Climate Movement. “Baltimore deserves a fair trial on the basis of climate justice.”",Amy Coney Barrett Set To Hear Case Against Shell—Her Dad’s Employer for 29 Years

A total of 22 major disasters, defined as each causing at least $1bn in damage, swept the US last year, six more than the previous record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). At least 262 people died, with $95bn in total damages recorded, the federal agency reported on Friday. The year was marked by punishing extremes on both the east and west coasts. It was the most active wildfire year on record in the US west, with California recording five of the six biggest fires in its history, an outbreak that destroyed thousands of homes and caused the sky to turn an apocalyptic orange over the San Francisco Bay Area. A total of 10.3m acres burned in wildfires in 2020 across the US west, an area larger than Maryland and well above this century’s average. On the eastern seaboard and Gulf of Mexico, a record 12 tropical storms made landfall during a year when forecasters had to turn to the Greek alphabet for storms’ names because the sheer number of events had exhausted the planned list of names. Seven of these caused more than $1bn in damage, including hurricanes Laura and Sally, which hit the US south in quick succession in August and September. Three hurricanes and two tropical storms hit Louisiana alone. A major drought and heatwave blasted the US west last year, there were three major tornado-related disasters and a highly destructive derecho, which is an event driven by fast-moving thunderstorms, that downed power lines, damaged houses and flattened crops in the midwest. Noaa reported that last year was the fifth hottest on record across the contiguous US, which follows a longer-term pattern of national and global heating — all of the five warmest years on record in the US have occurred since 2012. While hurricanes and wildfires have always hit the US, scientists have found that the strength of storms is increasing as the atmosphere and ocean heats up, while the area eaten up by fire has grown as rising temperatures dry out soils and vegetation. “The record number of climate change-exacerbated weather disasters this year drives home the fact that, as I like to say, the impacts of climate change are no longer subtle,” said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State. “We’re seeing them play out in real time. Hopefully this is the year where we finally see the sort of action, by the US and the rest of the world, that is necessary to prevent things from getting worse.”","22 Disasters, 262 Dead, $95B in Damages: 2020 Set Records for US Climate Mayhem"

Video courtesy of EKM Metering via Yale Environment 360. Let our journalists help you make sense of the noise: Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter and get a recap of news that matters. This story was originally published by Yale360 and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. The twin smokestacks of the Moss Landing Power Plant tower over Monterey Bay. Visible for miles along this picturesque stretch of the Northern California coast, the 500-foot-tall pillars crown what was once California’s largest electric power station—a behemoth natural gas-fired generator. Today, as California steadily moves to decarbonize its economy, those stacks are idle and the plant is largely mothballed. Instead, the site is about to begin a new life as the world’s largest battery, storing excess energy when solar panels and wind farms are producing electricity and feeding it back into the grid when they’re not. Inside a cavernous turbine building, a 300-megawatt lithium-ion battery is currently being readied for operation, with another 100-megawatt battery to come online in 2021. Together, they will be able to discharge enough electricity to power roughly 300,000 California homes for four hours during evenings, heatwaves, and other times when energy demand outstrips supply, according to project developer Vistra Energy. These aren’t the only super-sized batteries that will soon be operating at the Moss Landing plant. An additional 182.5 megawatts produced by 256 Tesla megapack batteries are scheduled to begin feeding into California’s electric grid in mid-2021, with plans to eventually add enough capacity at the site to power every home in nearby San Francisco for six hours, according to the Bay Area utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, which will own and operate the system. Elsewhere in California, a 250-megawatt storage project went online this year in San Diego, construction has begun on a 150-megawatt system near San Francisco, a 100-megawatt battery project is nearing completion in Long Beach, and a number of others are in various stages of development around the state. Driven by steeply falling prices and technological progress that allows batteries to store ever-larger amounts of energy, grid-scale systems are seeing record growth in the U.S. and around the world. Many of the gains are spillovers from the auto industry’s race to build smaller, cheaper, and more powerful lithium-ion batteries for electric cars. In the U.S., state clean energy mandates, along with tax incentives for storage systems that are paired with solar installations, are also playing an important role. California is currently the global leader in the effort to balance the intermittency of renewable energy in electric grids with high-capacity batteries. But the rest of the world is rapidly following suit. Recently announced plans range from a 409-megawatt system in South Florida, to a 320-megawatt plant near London, England, to a 200-megawatt facility in Lithuania and a 112-megawatt unit in Chile. The mass deployment of storage could overcome one of the biggest obstacles to renewable energy—its cycling between oversupply when the sun shines or the wind blows, and shortage when the sun sets or the wind drops. By smoothing imbalances between supply and demand, proponents say, batteries can replace fossil fuel “peaker” plants that kick in for a few hours a day when energy demands soar. Experts say that widespread energy storage is key to expanding the reach of renewables and speeding the transition to a carbon-free power grid. “Energy storage is actually the true bridge to a clean-energy future,” says Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association. How quickly that future arrives depends in large part on how rapidly costs continue to fall. Already the price tag for utility-scale battery storage in the United States has plummeted, dropping nearly 70 percent between 2015 and 2018, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This sharp price drop has been enabled by advances in lithium-ion battery chemistry that have significantly improved performance. Power capacity has expanded rapidly, and batteries can store and discharge energy over ever-longer periods of time. Market competition and rising battery production also play a major role; a projection by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory sees mid-range costs for lithium-ion batteries falling an additional 45 percent between 2018 and 2030. “We’re almost entirely piggybacking on the growth of lithium-ion battery technology, which is driven mostly by electric vehicles and consumer electronics,” says Ray Hohenstein, market applications director for Fluence, an energy storage technology provider with storage projects totaling nearly 1 gigawatt (1,000 megawatts) set to come online in California within a year. The money put into research for those applications is driving down costs across the board, says Hohenstein. “It’s just like what we saw with solar panels.” In California, falling battery prices, coupled with the state’s aggressive push toward a carbon-free electrical grid by 2045, have led to a packed pipeline of storage projects. A 2013 bill set a target of 1.325 gigawatts of storage to be commissioned for the state’s grid by 2020. With 1.5 gigawatts of projects now approved—including more than 500 megawatts installed so far—that goal has already been surpassed, according to the California Public Utilities Commission. While there is no precise figure for how much storage California will require to meet its carbon-free goal—the amount depends on the future technology mix, energy use, and other changing factors—some analyses estimate that at least 30 gigawatts of utility-scale storage will be needed by 2045. When the gigantic Moss Landing project becomes fully operational in mid-2021, it will more than double the amount of energy storage in California. Several other states are also now embarking on major energy storage projects. Among them: New York’s 316-megawatt Ravenswood project will be able to power more than 250,000 homes for up to eight hours, replacing two natural gas peaker plants in the New York City borough of Queens. And the 409-megawatt Manatee system planned for South Florida will be charged by an adjacent solar plant. Touted by utility Florida Power & Light as the world’s largest solar-powered battery system, the facility will replace two aging natural gas-fired units. Nationwide, a record 1.2 gigawatts of storage have been installed so far this year, according to Wood MacKenzie, a natural resources research and consulting firm. That number is projected to jump dramatically over the next five years, rising to nearly 7.5 gigawatts in 2025. Kelly Speakes-Backman, CEO of the U.S. Energy Storage Association, says that battery storage additions doubled in 2020, and would likely have tripled had it not been for construction slowdowns caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Tesla Despite its leadership in renewable energy development, Europe has been slower to get on board with storage. “In general, Europe is a bit more conservative,” says Daniele Gatti, analyst for IDTechEx, a United Kingdom-based market research firm specializing in emerging technology. Energy storage development in Europe has been hindered by a restrictive electricity market dominated by government auctions that tend to undervalue storage. Still, some big-battery projects are now taking shape, including the 320-megawatt Gateway system to be built at a new port facility near London. Globally, Gatti projects rapid growth in energy storage, reaching 1.2 terawatts (1,200 gigawatts) over the next decade. Key players include Australia, which in 2017 became the first nation to install major battery storage on its grid with the 100-megawatt Hornsdale Power Reserve, and is now planning to add another 300 megawatts near Victoria. The new system will dispatch electricity between states on an as-needed basis, maximizing the efficiency of existing transmission infrastructure and reducing the need for building new power lines that would sit idle most of the time. Similar projects are gearing up in Germany and elsewhere, highlighting an emerging role for batteries as transmission tools. And Saudi Arabia has just announced plans to overtake Moss Landing’s standing as the world’s largest battery with a massive solar-plus-storage system on the country’s west coast. The facility will provide 100-percent renewable energy around the clock to a resort complex of 50 hotels and 1,300 homes being built along the Red Sea. With a recent report concluding that most fossil fuel power plants in the U.S. will reach the end of their working life by 2035, experts say that the time for rapid growth in industrial-scale energy storage is at hand. Yiyi Zhou, a renewable power systems specialist with Bloomberg NEF, says that renewables combined with battery storage are already an economically viable alternative to building new gas peaker plants. Pairing electricity generation with storage works especially well with solar energy, which generally follows a predictable daily pattern. In the U.S., costs have also been helped by the federal Investment Tax Credit, a 30-percent tax rebate for new solar installations. In fact, says Zhou, as more solar energy enters the grid, the cost of operating gas plants actually goes up. “That’s mainly because they are forced to cycle on and off much more now because of solar penetration,” Zhou says. “This adds wear-and-tear, and shortens their lifetime.” Batteries are even beginning to reach a size—around 200 megawatts—that enables renewables to replace small- to medium-sized natural gas generators, Hohenstein says. “Now we’re able to truly build these hybrid resources—solar, storage, wind—and do the job that was traditionally done by fossil fuel power plants,” says Hohenstein, whose company is seeing a surge of interest in such large projects. Adding storage also makes renewable energy more profitable, says Wesley Cole, an energy analyst with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. “One of the challenges of renewable energy is the more you put on the grid, the more the value declines,” Cole says. Storage helps deal with that by soaking up excess energy that would have been lost in the middle of the day, when electricity demand is lower, and moving it to a time when it is more valuable. While energy storage is thriving in high-value markets, such as California, battery prices still need to come down more to reach large-scale global deployment. In the U.S., proponents hope the incoming Biden administration will pursue more favorable energy policies, including extending the Investment Tax Credit—which ramps down to 10 percent for commercial solar systems and ends for residential solar in 2022—and expanding the benefit to stand-alone storage. Even without further incentives, however, analysts are optimistic that battery prices will eventually drop low enough for widespread energy storage use. “We see storage being a large player across effectively every future we look at,” says Cole. “And not just one or two gigawatts… but tens to hundreds of gigawatts.”",Batteries Power Your Car.

This story was originally published by High Country News and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. From a distance, the green pines and the blue-gray haze that gently hug the valleys of the Black Hills merge into a deep black. The Lakota name “He Sapa”—meaning “black ridge”—describes this visual phenomenon. This is a place of origin for dozens of Native peoples and a revered landscape for more than 50 others. The land’s most recent, and perhaps longest-serving, stewards—the Oceti Sakowin, the Dakota, Nakota and Lakota people—hold the mountains central to their cosmos. The Black Hills are also central to the political territory drawn by the 1851 and 1868 Fort Laramie treaties. And they continue to be a crucial part of the strategic position that sustained Native resistance to white encroachment. They have become an international symbol of the call to return stolen land to Indigenous people. That’s why President Donald Trump chose to hold his July 3 rally at Mount Rushmore, said Nick Tilsen, who is Oglala Lakota. The faces of U.S. Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln are carved into the side of the granite mountain that is the heart of the Lakota universe. Tilsen is the president and CEO of NDN Collective, a Native-run nonprofit based in Rapid City, South Dakota, which launched a campaign on Indigenous Peoples’ Day in 2020 to return He Sapa to Native people. Many Lakota people, like Tilsen, view the national monument, which attracts 2 million visitors a year, as a desecration of a spiritual landscape. “What South Dakota and the National Park Service call ‘a shrine to democracy’ is actually an international symbol of white supremacy,” Tilsen said. He was among 20 arrested for protesting Trump’s visit. If convicted, he faces up to 16½ years in prison for four felonies and three misdemeanors. According to Tilsen, the protesters had negotiated the blockade with the Pennington County Sheriff’s Office and the South Dakota Highway Patrol. The activists blocked the road, using three disabled vans to bar the way. “It was to hold space and connect our issue to the world,” Tilsen explained. Tilsen and others worked throughout the day to keep the protests organized, even speaking directly with park authorities to ensure that elderly activists and children were allowed to move away before any arrests were made. Soon, deputies announced that the assembly was unlawful, and the Air National Guard moved in, dressed in riot gear, pushing the protesters back and firing pepper balls at the retreating crowd. “A lot of the protectors had coup sticks, eagle feathers, and (sage) smudge sticks—and everything that you could think of that was sacred to us,” Laura Ten Fingers, one of the young Lakotas who helped organize the protest, recalled. A group of Trump supporters stood behind the police line, she said, shouting at the crowd “to go back to where you come from.” “It was really heartbreaking to hear them to say, ‘Go back,'” she said. “He Sapa was our home, and we came from there.” During the confrontation, Tilsen took a National Guard riot shield. He was arrested and charged with felony theft and robbery. When the shield was returned, the word “POLICE” had been spray-painted over and replaced by the slogan “LAND BACK.” That slogan put the Black Hills at the center of a movement whose unequivocal demands are rooted in a long, hard-fought history. “I don’t want to be the next Leonard Peltier,” Tilsen told me, referring to the legendary American Indian Movement activist, who has been imprisoned since 1977 for the murder of two FBI agents. (Peltier has always maintained his innocence.) Tilsen believes the police are trying “to coin me as a radical fringe activist.” He’s a father of four whose organization is currently running a nationwide emergency COVID-19 relief effort for Native communities. “I was a speaker at the Chamber of Commerce a year and a half ago. NDN Collective is on Main Street in Rapid City,” he said. Still, Tilsen would never deny his connection to Leonard Peltier or the American Indian Movement. It is, after all, deep in his family history. Nick Tilsen at a 2019 Keystone XL pipeline protest in Rapid City.  Adam Fondren/AP His Jewish grandfather, Kenneth Tilsen, was a prominent civil rights attorney, who with his wife, Rachel (daughter of the celebrated socialist writer Meridel Le Sueur) defended draft resisters during the Vietnam War. Later, the couple helped form the Wounded Knee Defense/Offense Committee for the American Indian Movement (AIM) leadership trials. Tilsen’s Lakota mother, Joann Tall, worked with her uncle, Pedro Bissonette, and the Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization, a group led by Lakota elders who had asked AIM for armed protection against a repressive tribal government in Pine Ridge in 1973. Tilsen’s parents met during the siege, when federal officers fired more than 200,000 rounds of ammunition at Native protesters—killing two, including Bissonette—at the very site where the 7th Cavalry, George Armstrong Custer’s former regiment, massacred hundreds of Lakota Ghost Dancers in 1890. All that happened just down the road from Tilsen’s home. Raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the birthplace of AIM, Tilsen spent his summers in Pine Ridge, where he was born, immersed in the movement. He returned to the reservation at 19 to live and work. “The Black Hills issue is part of my identity,” he said. In Lakota Country—where the shadows of history linger, on the land and in one’s family tree—a new generation is continuing the fight. The loss of the Black Hills has come to represent all the injustices Lakota people have suffered. “It’s not just about physical land back,” Tilsen said. “It’s also about undoing what was done to us as a people.” Also down the road from Tilsen’s home, just outside of Porcupine on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, is KILI, “the voice of the Lakota Nation”—the radio station his parents helped jumpstart in the 1990s. A tribal radio station was among the original demands behind the 71-day armed takeover of Wounded Knee; activists hoped that publicly broadcasting council meetings would end tribal government corruption. Land theft brought material deprivation. The Lakota and Dakota people inhabit several of the poorest counties in the United States. Tilsen’s home, Oglala Lakota County, is one of them. “As Indigenous people, we have the lowest economic conditions of anyone in America,” he said. Native American children in South Dakota have the lowest rates of economic mobility in the nation, according to a 2017 Annie E. Casey Foundation report. “A more ripe and rank case of dishonorable dealings will never, in all probability, be found in our history.” That is how a 1980 U.S. Supreme Court opinion described the theft of the Black Hills from the “Sioux Nation of Indians.” The court awarded the tribe $102 million; today, with the accumulated interest, it comes to nearly $2 billion. But the Lakota position remains unwavering, as shown by the popular slogan, “The Black Hills are not for sale!” The relationship with He Sapa cannot be translated into money. The land itself, the tribes said, must be returned. Before jackhammers and dynamite chiseled the heads of presidents into the cliff faces, miners cut deep into the Black Hills, in search of a subterranean El Dorado. Custer, a Civil War veteran turned Indian fighter, discovered gold in 1874 near the town that now bears his name. In a treaty signed at Fort Laramie just six years earlier, the United States had pledged that a reservation—a 35 million-acre “permanent home” encompassing the entirety of what is currently the half of South Dakota west of the Missouri River—would be “set apart for the absolute and undisturbed use and occupation” of the Sioux Nation. A bloody war erupted over Custer’s trespass into treaty territory, a sin for which he and 250 of his men paid with their lives. By the time the dust settled, the place was booming. In 1877, under the administration of President Ulysses S. Grant, the former Union general, the 1868 treaty was abrogated. The Black Hills were seized, the people threatened with starvation. Prospectors hoping to strike paydirt moved in, and frontier towns like Deadwood—notorious for their trade in women, gambling and violence—sprang up, forming the bulwark of white settlement. For 125 years, miners attacked the earth, drawing 10 percent of the world’s gold supply from its ore-rich veins. The rise of automobiles and the tourist industry created new fortunes for the interlopers. In the 1920s, South Dakota’s first state historian, Doane Robinson, proposed building a massive sculpture to attract visitors to the remote location. But finding an artist willing to undertake such a feat wasn’t easy. Robinson had been moved by the recently constructed memorial at Stone Mountain in Georgia, which honored the defenders of the Civil War’s inglorious “Lost Cause.” He contacted its flamboyant sculptor, Gutzon Borglum, who quickly accepted the offer. Mount Rushmore came to South Dakota by way of a Southern, white supremacist ideology that blended easily with the West’s sense of Manifest Destiny. Borglum himself was a bridge: The child of a polygamist Mormon family of Danish settlers in Idaho, he made a name for himself as an artist in service of the Ku Klux Klan. On Thanksgiving Day 1915, the so-called “Invisible Empire” was reborn in a torchlight ceremony atop Stone Mountain. The site is still sacred to the Klan and Confederate sympathizers. The next year, the Daughters of the Confederacy drafted a plan to commemorate the occasion with a memorial. By 1923, Borglum was a trusted Klan insider who served on the Kloncilium, the highest decision-making body, second only to the Grand Wizard. He was a natural candidate for the Stone Mountain job. The Klan hardened Borglum’s strident xenophobia and belief in European—meaning Nordic—racial superiority. But Stone Mountain was too geopolitically specific—too distinctly Southern—to capture his grand nationalist vision. He saw the Black Hills as ideal, “so near the center of our country or so suitable for (a) colossal sculpture.” His monument would “symbolize the principles of liberty and freedom on which the nation was founded,” he later wrote. More fundamentally, it would assert white possession, not just over the Black Hills but over the entire continent. The ancient granite hills would bear both gold and glory for the United States with the busts of four of its presidents. In a letter to Robinson, Borglum warned that if his masterpiece wasn’t constructed properly, “we will only wound the mountain, offend the Gods, and deserve condemnation for posterity.” In 1936, an awestruck Franklin Delano Roosevelt echoed Borglum as he gazed up at the nearly completed shrine. Its size, its “permanent beauty” and “permanent importance” meant that “ten thousand years from now” Americans would meditate in reverence here. Almost a century later, Trump proclaimed, “Mount Rushmore will stand forever as an eternal tribute to our forefathers and to our freedom.” The crowd chanted, “USA! USA! USA!” Lakota people have occupied the Black Hills for generations. In 1970, at the height of the Red Power movement, John (Fire) Lame Deer, a Lakota holy man, climbed the monument and sat on Teddy Roosevelt’s head, “giving him a headache, maybe.” Native students and activists had taken over Alcatraz Island in the San Francisco Bay a year earlier. Lame Deer was at a protest camp on top of the monument, with a banner that read “Red Power—Indian Land.” Frustrated by getting no response from the federal government, Lizzy Fast Horse, a Lakota grandmother and one of the camp’s founders, and some accomplices decided to take back the Black Hills themselves. Fast Horse was among those calling for the United States to return 200,000 acres of Oglala Lakota land that had been confiscated during World War II for a gunnery and bombing range. She and two other Lakota women hid from park rangers and police, braving lightning storms as they made their way up the mountain. “We got braver and braver, and now we’re not afraid of anyone,” Fast Horse said at the time. Lee Brightman, the Lakota founder of United Native Americans, explained the camp’s goals: “We want payment for the Black Hills, for all the minerals mined, for the timber taken out. And we want our sacred mountains back.” Those demands go far back, according to Charmaine White Face, the first Oglala woman spokesperson for the Sioux Nation Treaty Council. “It was illegal to talk about the (1868) treaty” when the treaty council formed in 1894, “just like the language was prohibited, just like our religion was prohibited by the American government.” But times have changed: White Face believes that her grandmother’s treaty knowledge, which survived government suppression, can be useful for the “land back” campaign. This history is why Nick Tilsen loves the slogan. “You have elders saying ‘land back,’” he chuckles. “You want your land back? Hell yeah, I want my land back. I’ve been wanting my land back.” No one owns the phrase, he said; it “has lived in the spirit of the people for a long time.” “Not only has this been a long generational battle, it is also part of this current moment,” said Krystal Two Bulls. The Northern Cheyenne and Oglala Lakota military veteran heads NDN Collective’s LandBack campaign, which was launched last Indigenous Peoples’ Day with the goal of returning public lands in the Black Hills to the Oceti Sakowin, starting with Mount Rushmore. “Public land is the first manageable bite,” she said, “then we’re coming for everything else.” This would usher an era of free and prior informed consent; tribes would form meaningful partnerships to promote land stewardship and equitable housing, and address more than a century of wrongdoings. In the Black Hills, the idea has traction. In 1987, New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, a former New York Knicks basketball player, introduced legislation drafted by Lakota people to return 1.3 million acres, targeting Park Service land, not private land. The bill died in committee. Two Bulls sees land return as a moral issue more than a legal one. It’s not about ownership, she said, but stewardship. “As a Northern Cheyenne woman, part of my original instructions is to be in relationship with the land as a steward.” To Laura Ten Fingers, the idea of ownership doesn’t entirely mesh with Lakota relations with the land. “To me, ‘land back’ means that—it’s not that we own the land,” she said. “The land owns you. It’s a way of ensuring it’s protected and preserved by the people who originally took care of it, which is us.” From her home in Oglala on the Pine Ridge Reservation, Ten Fingers watched the George Floyd protests erupt in Minneapolis and spread across the nation. “The momentum of the Black Lives Matter movement also created (a space) for Indigenous sovereignty,” she said. Inspired, she and her friends put out the first call to protest Trump’s visit. Trump’s visit to Mount Rushmore—like his rally the day after Juneteenth in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the site of an infamous race massacre in 1921—was part of a series of raucous campaign rallies aimed at firing up his base and provoking his political opponents. “Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values, and indoctrinate our children,” Trump warned the crowd at the base of Mount Rushmore, the day before Independence Day last year. He blamed “cancel culture”—which he called “the very definition of totalitarianism”—for the recent toppling of Confederate statues and monuments and other controversial historical figures. A week earlier, he signed an executive order that condemned the destruction as the actions of “rioters, arsonists, and left-wing extremists,” calling for the arrest of vandals who destroyed federal property and their imprisonment for up to 10 years. “Do you know, it’s my dream to have my face on Mount Rushmore,” Trump told South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem when they first met in the Oval Office. “He was totally serious,” Noem, who invited Trump to Mount Rushmore, told the Sioux Falls Argus Leader in 2018. Trump’s arrival only inflamed the long-standing tensions between tribes and the state of South Dakota. Lakota leaders saw his visit as retaliation for their opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline and to the state’s lack of response to the coronavirus pandemic. That May, Noem had threatened “legal action” against the tribal health checkpoints set up to curtail the spread of the virus, claiming they interfered with traffic. “We will not apologize for being an island of safety in a sea of uncertainty and death,” Harold Frazier, chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, wrote to Noem in reply. Her state has some of the nation’s highest rates of infection and death. South Dakota backed down. The Cheyenne River, Rosebud and Oglala Sioux tribal chairmen all wrote letters protesting Trump’s visit, citing public health concerns and the continued indifference toward Lakota treaty rights. In separate statements, Frazier and Julian Running Bear, the president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, demanded the return of the Black Hills. They also called for the removal of Mount Rushmore itself, which Frazier described as a “brand on our flesh (that) needs to be removed,” adding, “I am willing to do it free of charge to the United States, by myself if I must.” But history moves on. In November, Trump lost his bid for re-election; the Rapid City Council voted to return 1,200 acres in the Black Hills to the Oceti Sakowin; and in Rapid City, Lakota activists set up Camp Mni Luzahan to house Native people living on the streets so that they don’t die of exposure during the harsh winter months. But the pipeline protests have also sharpened disputes between tribes and the state. South Dakota lawmakers feared another massive protest like Standing Rock in 2016. So the Legislature criminalized pipeline-related protests ahead of the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. Noem introduced a controversial “riot boosting” law, which would have created civil and criminal penalties for individuals who supported any “incitement to riot,” claiming it was necessary to address problems caused by “out-of-state rioters funded by out-of-state interests.” This was the battle Tilsen found himself in. He testified against the law at the state Capitol and was a named plaintiff in the ACLU lawsuit that successfully challenged its constitutionality. “We helped water down the current riot boosting law, to make it as weak as possible,” Tilsen explained. He saw it as a win for free speech and treaty rights, as well as the right to legally protest Keystone XL. “It’s a reminder,” Tilsen said, “as Indigenous people, we’re fighting for justice not just for ourselves but also on behalf of millions of Americans.” In March 2020, Noem signed a revised version of the law. It was at Mount Rushmore in the early 1870s that Black Elk, the Oglala holy man, had a vision of He Sapa: “From the mountains flashed all colors upwards to the heavens.” He was at the center of the world atop Tunkasila Sakpe, the Six Grandfathers. The mountain would be named for Black Elk’s vision that day. He saw a great hoop made up of many hoops of a people united. In the center grew a flowering tree, he recalled, “and I saw that it was holy.” In August, a magistrate judge ruled that there was evidence for the trial to move forward. Tilsen hopes his case and the LandBack campaign will have a similar catalyzing effect, not only for the land-return movement but for the restored dignity of his people. “It was powerful,” Tilsen said, remembering that day. “There was between 100 and 200 of us. It must have felt like there were thousands of us, because you could feel that spiritual power from the hills. The ancestors were waiting for us to go up there.”    Nick Estes (Lower Brule Sioux Tribe) is an assistant professor of American studies at the University of New Mexico and the author of Our History is the Future: Standing Rock Versus the Dakota Access Pipeline, and the Long Tradition of Indigenous Resistance (Verso, 2019)",This Land Is Our Land
295,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/01/climate-change-is-turning-our-cities-into-ovens/,MJ,Far Left,"New Jerseyite Wayne Semancik cools off during a July 2006 heat wave in New York City. Michael Brown/Getty This story was originally published by Wired and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. WHICHEVER SIDE OF the subjective city-versus-rural debate you’re on, the objective laws of thermodynamics dictate that cities lose on at least one front: They tend to get insufferably hotter, more so than surrounding rural areas. That’s thanks to the urban heat-island effect, in which buildings and roads readily absorb the sun’s energy and release it well into the night. The greenery of rural areas, by contrast, provides shade and cools the air by releasing water. Climate change is making the urban heat-island effect all the more dire in cities across the world, and it’s only going to get worse. Like, way worse. An international team of researchers has used a new modeling technique to estimate that by the year 2100, the world’s cities could warm by as much as 4.4 degrees Celsius on average. For perspective, that figure obliterates the Paris agreement’s optimistic goal for a global average temperature rise of 1.5 degrees C from preindustrial levels. In fact, the team’s figure more than doubles the agreement’s hard goal of limiting that global rise to no more than 2 degrees C. Up until this point, global climate models have tended to snub urban areas, and for good reason, as they make up just 3 percent of the planet’s land surface. Cities are but a blip. Researchers are more interested in the dynamics of things like the ocean, ice, and air currents. “We’re closing this kind of gap,” says Lei Zhao, a climate scientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and lead author on a recent paper published in Nature Climate Change describing the modeling. “We provide urban-specific projections for the future.” His team’s model suggests that hotter cities could be catastrophic for urban public health, which is already suffering from the effects of increasing heat. Between 2000 and 2016, according to the World Health Organization, the number of people exposed to heat waves jumped by 125 million, and extreme heat claimed more than 166,000 lives between 1998 and 2017. And while at the moment half the world’s population lives in urban areas, that proportion is expected to rise to 70 percent by 2050, according to the authors of this new paper. People in search of economic opportunity are unknowingly rushing into peril. “When I read these papers, I just don’t know what’s wrong with humanity, to be honest with you. Because this is like the same song being sung by different people,” says climate scientist Camilo Mora of the University of Hawaii at Manoa, who wasn’t involved in the work. “Come on, man! When are we going to get serious about this problem? This is another person ringing the bell. We just for some reason refuse to hear this thing.” Mora likens the simultaneous risks of climate change and the heat-island effect to having to battle two foes at once. “Dealing with climate change is like getting into a fight with Mike Tyson,” he says. “With the heat-island effect that these guys just documented here, that is now like bringing Jackie Chan on top of Mike Tyson. So now you gotta face those two guys—there is just no way for people to cope with this.” To model how these two forces might affect cities, Zhao and his team turned their statistical model into an “emulator,” which mimics complex climate models, but focuses on urban areas. They could then apply the emulator to results from over two dozen global climate models, assuming either intermediate or high emission levels going forward, to translate coarse climate model outputs to the city level. When they assumed an intermediate level of emissions, they found that, on average, the planet’s urban regions could warm 1.9 degrees C over the next 80 years; when they assumed a high level, the figure became an astonishing 4.4 degrees C. Overall, it’s bad news no matter where a city-dweller lives, but urban areas will be affected in different ways. For instance, the modeling found that the northern United States, particularly the upper Midwest, will warm more than the southern US. When it comes to relative humidity, inland cities around the world will tend to dry, while coastal cities will stay wetter—which makes good sense, given that they’re next to water. Humanity can, though, brace its urban areas for the brutal heat that climate change is already delivering—by making them more rural. Greening public spaces both beautifies them and provides people with shade. Each tree’s leaves also act like tiny air conditioners, releasing moisture to cool the environment. And the less the pavement is exposed to the sun, the less the built environment will absorb its energy. With the arrival of the Biden administration, the US could even revive the New Deal’s Civilian Conservation Corps, putting people back to work greening up cities. That’ll be especially critical in communities of color and low-income neighborhoods, which tend to be less green and thus more likely to suffer from the heat-island effect, a consequence of racist housing policies. Plus, says Elizabeth Sawin, codirector of Climate Interactive, a nonprofit that focuses on the intersection of climate change and inequity, greening creates jobs. You need people to grow the trees in a nursery, and then others to plant and maintain them, for instance. “Particularly when that can be done in partnership with the communities, there’s a real opportunity to train people in new skills,” she says. “Those would be investments that really would help cities adapt to the climate change we can’t prevent.”",Climate Change Is Slowly Turning Our Cities Into Saunas

The world may be barreling towards climate disaster but rapidly eliminating planet-heating emissions means global temperatures could stabilize within just a couple of decades, scientists say. For many years it was assumed that further global heating would be locked in for generations even if emissions were rapidly cut. Climate models run by scientists on future temperatures were based on a certain carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. If this remained at the current high level there would be runaway climate disaster, with temperatures continuing to rise even if emissions were reduced because of a lag time before greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere. But more recent understanding of the implications of getting to net zero emissions is giving hope that the warming could be more swiftly curtailed. More than 100 countries have pledged to get to net zero by 2050, which means they will emit no more carbon dioxide than is removed from the atmosphere by, for example, restoring forests. The UK, Japan and the European Union have set this net zero target and will soon be joined by the US under Joe Biden’s new administration. Should this be achieved globally, “surface temperatures stop warming and warming stabilizes within a couple decades,” said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. “What this really means is that our actions have a direct and immediate impact on surface warming. It grants us agency, which is part of why it is so important to communicate this current best scientific understanding.” Scientists have now factored in the dynamism of the Earth’s natural systems, whereby stopping emissions would actually see atmospheric CO2 content go down due to the huge carbon absorption capacity of oceans, wetlands and forests. Mann likens it to filling up a sink with water with the drain partially open — the water level will still rise due to the incoming water but if you reduce the water flow it will drop due to the drain remaining open. “This falling atmospheric CO2 causes enough cooling to balance out the warming ‘in the pipeline’ due to slow ocean heat uptake, and global temperatures remain relatively flat after net-zero emissions are reached,” said Zeke Hausfather, a climate expert at the Breakthrough Institute. “The main takeaway for me is that this is good news, because it means that how much warming happens this century and beyond is up to us.” The disastrous present-day trajectory of the world’s climate has been highlighted by a new paper that shows the world is committed to more than 2C of heating compared with the pre-industrial period based on current atmospheric compositions of greenhouse gases. The world has already heated up by 1.1C in this time and governments have committed to restraining the rise to 1.5C to avoid punishing heatwaves, flooding, mass displacement of people and other calamities. The paper on “committed warming” appears to spell doom for the goals of the Paris climate agreement, as well as for millions of people in vulnerable parts of the world, but the authors point out that cutting emissions would slow the pace of this temperature rise, potentially spanning centuries. This would give civilization time to adapt to the changes or come up with technological fixes. “At the moment we are changing the temperature a hundred times faster than what happened in the last ice age,” said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University and co-author of the paper, published in Nature Climate Change. “An extra degree in a few hundred years is far less damaging than a degree in a few decades. The timescale is important.” Dessler said he believed there could still be some warming even under net zero emissions but that the goal of decarbonization was vital. “The problem is still very severe, we need to reduce emissions as fast as possible and we will deal with committed warming afterwards,” he said. Joeri Rogelj, a climate lecturer at Imperial College London, said he was confident if the world became net zero in the coming decades it would be possible to remove further CO2 from the atmosphere to push down on escalating temperatures. But he added that “bending the global emissions curve on to a global trajectory towards net zero is really the first and foremost task we have to tackle with great urgency.”","Global Temperatures Could Stabilize, Scientists Say, If We Do the Following"

Kenneth Whitten/Design Pics via ZUMA The same day the nation watched pro-Trump supporters stage a coup at the Capitol, the Bureau of Land Management held its most controversial auction yet in the 1.5 million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an environmentally sensitive coastal plane that the native Gwich’in people call the “The Sacred Place Where Life Begins.” The firesale for oil and gas leasing only raised a small fraction of revenue Republicans had estimated it could generate. Though the sales aren’t final yet, environmentalists already suspect the Trump administration will skip mandatory steps in its rush to approve leases before president-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration. The Trump administration has managed to rush through some of its most enduring environmental rollbacks in the president’s final days. By now it’s clear that the pandemic, the election, and even Wednesday’s domestic terrorist attack won’t slow down the polluter free-for-all. Earlier this week, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized a regulation that censors the science the agency can consider in its rulemaking, a policy that was first championed by the tobacco industry. And in the last few months, according to a list assembled by the advocacy group Public Citizen, the administration has rushed to finish at least 15 other environmental reversals like it.  One of the quickest and easiest way to clean up the mess that Trump has made? The slim Democratic majority in Congress will have the chance to invoke the Congressional Review Act (CRA). The law allows a simple majority of Congress to reverse regulations that a president finalized in the last 60 working days of the congressional calendar. In 2017, Republicans used the once-obscure law to reverse 14 Obama regulations, including an environmental rule regulating coal ash runoff into streams. Trump rules finalized since mid-August are candidates for repeal using the CRA. The rollbacks include manipulating how the EPA justifies new environmental protections, allowing seismic testing in the Gulf, loosening regulations for coal ash disposal, rejecting tougher standards for soot, limiting wildlife protections, and lowering efficiency standards for showerheads, dishwashers, and washing machines.  “The CRA is a tool, albeit an imperfect tool, to undo a lot of the damage that Trump has done,” said Matt Kent, Public Citizen’s regulatory policy associate. But there’s a cost to using it. Each regulation must be addressed individually, within the first few months of Congress, sucking up valuable time when the Biden administration will also need to seek Senate confirmation for appointments and Senate floor time to debate new legislation. Kent doesn’t expect the CRA to be used as a “big firehose,” but as a more targeted approach.  Two good candidates for the CRA are the recent rule to censor science and a second to manipulate how the EPA considers costs and benefits to new rulemaking, both of which will make it much harder to strengthen other environmental standards. (The Trump administration has tried to circumvent the likelihood of their repeal by arguing that they are not subject to the CRA. The administration claims—incorrectly, environmentalists say—that the rules are procedural changes, which are exempt.) There are other problems with the CRA: The window of 60 days would miss some of the most damaging reversals of the Trump administration, like freezing fuel efficiency and clean power sector standards and weakening restrictions on methane from gas operations. Second, it’s unclear how the CRA, as a largely untested law in courts, would apply to Trump’s other actions like lease sales in the Arctic.  The other options left to the Biden administration won’t be as quick. Some of Trump’s sloppiest rules may be thrown out by courts: Two dozen states are already suing over Trump’s fuel economy rules finalized in March. But for other rules, agencies like the EPA will have a daunting task: writing their justification for rescinding the weak rules, and then rewriting draft and final regulations for stronger protections. All of this will be subject to public comment—a process that will take time and resources. All told, it won’t be an easy feat for Biden to wipe the slate clean from Trump’s mess. The more rules that Trump’s agencies destroy in his last few days in office, the bigger the challenge facing the Biden administration to pick up the pieces, let alone advance on goals to seriously tackle climate pollution. Trump’s real intention is “to clog up the works and slow the Biden administration down,” said Richard Revesz, an environmental regulatory expert at New York University’s Institute for Policy Integrity. “Repealing and replacing them will take time, and will tie up agency resources. And I think that’s exactly what the Trump administration is trying to accomplish.”",The Quickest Way to Undo Trump’s Environmental Mess Isn’t as Easy as You’d Think

Debra Haaland is making American history. The 60-year-old congresswoman from New Mexico will next month become the first Native American cabinet secretary in US history, when she takes responsibility for the country’s land and natural resources as head of the Department of the Interior under Joe Biden. Haaland is a member of the Laguna Pueblo, one of 574 sovereign tribal nations located across 35 states. According to the 2010 census, 5.2 million people or about 2% of the US population identifies as American Indian or Alaskan Native—descendants of those who survived US government policies to kill, remove or assimilate indigenous peoples. Come January it will also be Haaland’s job to uphold the government’s legally binding obligations to the tribes—treaty obligations which have been systematically violated with devastating consequences for life expectancy, political participation and economic opportunities in Indian Country. In an interview days before her nomination, Haaland told The Guardian that as secretary of the interior she would “move climate change priorities, tribal consultation and a green economic recovery forward.” It’s a big job with high expectations after four years of racist rhetoric and destructive environmental rollbacks by the Trump administration, which showed contempt for the climate or environment by green-lighting planet-heating fossil fuel projects on public and tribal lands with little regard for culturally and ecologically important sites. “I’ll be fierce for all of us, for our planet, and all of our protected land,” said Haaland in her acceptance speech. “This moment is profound when we consider the fact that a former secretary of the interior once proclaimed it his goal to, quote, ‘civilize or exterminate’ us. I’m a living testament to the failure of that horrific ideology.” Indigenous communities in the US, and globally, are disproportionately vulnerable to the impact of the climate crisis such as rising sea levels and droughts, and environmental hazards resulting from polluting industries. As secretary of the interior, Haaland will play a key role in undoing Trump’s rollbacks and will also be a key lieutenant in Biden’s new climate team. This is not the first time Haaland has made history. In 2018, she became one of the first two Native women in Congress, alongside Sharice Davids of Kansas. In January, a record-breaking six Native Americans—four Democrats and two Republicans—will be sworn in. Representation and diversity matter, according to Haaland, because life experiences shape political decisions. “We don’t need people who all have the same perspective, we need people from various parts of the country, who’ve been raised in different ways, who bring that history and culture with them, and employ what we’ve learnt from their parents and grandparents, and bring all of that to bear in the decisions that we make,” she told The Guardian. It’s been a rocky road for Haaland who like a disproportionate number of Native Americans has experienced homelessness and relied on food stamps. She is also the product of racist policies such as the forced removal of thousands of Native children from their families between 1860 and 1978. At the age of eight, Haaland’s grandmother was sent to a Catholic boarding school for five years a hundred miles from home. “There are a lot of people in this country who suffered historical trauma from that era. I carry that history with me, I’m a product of the assimilation policy of the United States. I feel very strongly that having this perspective is super important for the issues we bring to Congress.” “Indigenous women have been missing and murdered since Europeans came to this continent in the late 1400s. Violence against women is a priority of mine. It’s not going to be fixed with just two pieces of legislation, but now it’s time to dig deeper and keep working,” she said. Haaland will be the most senior Native American in the US government since the Republican Charles Curtis, a member of the Kaw nation situated in what is now Kansas, who served as vice-president to Herbert Hoover between 1929 and 1933. She will be part of a government facing unprecedented complex and interconnected challenges including an out-of-control pandemic, global economic recession, spiralling hunger and the climate emergency. Haaland’s track record working across partisan lines may also prove vital for Biden’s success, at a time when the country—and lawmakers—are deeply divided. She said: “I’ve gotten more Republicans to sign on to my bills than any other Democrat. It’s important for all of us—county commissioners, governors and mayors, not just Congress—to make sure we’re working together for the greater good. We want to pass laws that will help people across the country, and we need to make sure these messages are getting out…I’m going to continue to reach across the aisle, to protect our environment and make sure that vulnerable communities have a say in what our country is doing moving forward.” The Department of the Interior’s 70,000 or so staff oversee one-fifth of all the land in the US and 1.7bn acres of coastlines, as well as managing national parks, wildlife refuges and natural resources such as gas, oil and water. A shift in priorities at the interior department could have major implications for global heating as about one-quarter of all US carbon emissions come from fossil fuels extracted on public lands, according to the US Geological Survey. Earlier this year, Haaland sponsored a bill that would set a national goal of protecting 30% of US lands and oceans by 2030 – a plan since adopted by the Biden administration as a priority for his environmental agenda. “Environmental injustice and economic injustice have taken a hold of so many communities, and they’ve had enough. They want us to pay attention and help them to succeed … As far as Indian Country is concerned, I want to make sure tribal leaders – and all marginalized communities – have a seat at the table.” In stark contrast to Trump, Haaland believes that Biden will consult Native Americans – as the government is legally obliged to do. “I am confident that this president will pay attention to Indian Country, that’s why I believe so many [Native Americans] came out to vote, and helped him win Arizona and Wisconsin.” Restoring protections eroded by Trump for Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante – national monuments in southern Utah which are sacred to Native Americans, is a priority for Haaland. November’s elections took place after a summer of unprecedented protests demanding racial justice sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who was killed by a white police officer kneeling on his neck for almost nine minutes. Progressive Democrats, including Haaland and the so-called Squad – made up of congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib – elevated demands by protesters for radical structural changes to eradicate racial inequalities in health, housing, immigration, education, jobs and the environment. “So many Native Americans joined the Black Lives Matter protests because Indian Country recognised that we are allies in the fight for environmental justice, economic justice and racial justice … These communities on the frontline deserve to have the resources to be able to lift themselves up,” Haaland said. • This article was amended on 29 December 2020 because an earlier version cited an old figure in saying there are 567 sovereign tribal nations in the US. There are currently 574 federally recognized tribes.","“I’ll Be Fierce for All of Us”: Deb Haaland on Climate, Native Rights, and Joe Biden"

Losing the Arecibo Observatory radio telescope to the sands of time is sadly emotional for many. For scientists, it marks the end of an era. For Puerto Ricans, it’s a blow to our pride. Daybreak on Tuesday, December 1 revealed that the 900-ton instrument platform of the Arecibo Observatory had collapsed. The National Science Foundation had previously established an exclusion zone for fear that this would happen, after some cables had snapped and the structure appeared to be in danger. So far, no injuries have been reported. The instrument platform of the 305m telescope at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico fell overnight. No injuries were reported. NSF is working with stakeholders to assess the situation. Our top priority is maintaining safety. NSF will release more details when they are confirmed. pic.twitter.com/Xjbb9hPUgD — National Science Foundation (@NSF) December 1, 2020  The National Science Foundation had announced earlier, on Thursday, November 19, that it would  decommission and dismantle Arecibo. This radio telescope, for decades the world’s largest, had operated for 57 years, withstanding numerous hurricanes—the last one a Category 4 storm, Hurricane María, which in 2017 damaged the approximately 30 meter-long (about 100 foot), 430 megahertz radar transmitter that is suspended high above the thousand-foot wide dish (see photo). The radio telescope survived that incident, but later this year massive steel supporting cables came loose, gashed huge holes in the telescope’s reflector dish, and threatened the structural integrity of the supports for the suspended platform that held the receiver and transmitters. Exactly why the first of the several cables holding up the platform slipped out of its socket has still not been pinpointed. It’s unclear if recent earthquakes have played a role; while a still-active earthquake sequence—in which many seismic events, including a mainshock, occur in a local area in a relatively short period of time—did significant damage in Puerto Rico over the past year, the shaking on the north side of the island where Arecibo is located was attenuated compared to the south and southwest areas closest to the epicenters. Regardless of what caused the first cable to fail, when it did break, it put excess strain on the others and caused a second cable to snap in half. Worried that additional cables may go at any time and lead to catastrophic failure, the National Science Foundation decided to close the Arecibo dish permanently in the latter half of November—and then the huge telescope, already damaged, collapsed on December 1. The Arecibo Observatory was legendary. It was placed in Puerto Rico’s karst country because the unique soft limestone landscape—characterized by steep ridges and deep ravines—allowed for the nestling of a 300-meter (1000 feet) diameter spherical reflector collecting dish nicely into one of the U-shaped valleys created by sinkholes between haystack-shaped hills. The towers holding the instrumentation that’s suspended 150 meters above the dish were built on top of the surrounding karst ridges. Pictures could do no justice to this spectacular engineering marvel. Puerto Rico’s radio telescope had been placed in the National Register of Historic Places. Its supporting role as a filming location for Contact with Jodie Foster and GoldenEye with Pierce Brosnan as 007 shined a popular culture spotlight on the observatory. But Hollywood didn’t make the Arecibo Observatory famous. Science did. In 1964, almost immediately after the observatory’s commissioning, planetary scientists studying Mercury discovered that it rotated every 59 days instead of every 88 days. A few years later in 1968, the first robust evidence that neutron stars existed was gathered at Arecibo. The first binary pulsar was first discovered there in 1974, leading to a Nobel Prize in Physics for the scientists spearheading the effort. And incredible phenomena have been detected, like a millisecond pulsar that rotates 642 times per second! Like many tools of modern science, the impetus for building the radio telescope came initially from the military, which sought to monitor the ionosphere for the telltale signatures left by possible nuclear missiles reentering the atmosphere. Eventually designed for the dual purpose of ionospheric and astronomical studies under the direction of Cornell University—which operated the observatory until 2011—the unique beam-steering mechanism suspended high above the reflector dish allowed for a moveable focal point that could aim at different parts of the sky. That functionality had continued to yield dividends in 2020. NASA’s Planetary Defense program was using the Arecibo radio telescope to precisely measure the size, shape, dynamics and orbits of Near-Earth Objects like asteroids that could potentially pose a threat to Earth. Even supermassive black holes were still being studied. As a magnificent instrument of science, a source of so many discoveries, and as Puerto Rico’s scientific icon, Arecibo served as an inspiration to me and countless other aspiring scientists in Puerto Rico and around the world. Its visitor center hosted thousands of Puerto Rican schoolchildren for educational visits, and the Arecibo Observatory Space Academy provided teacher training workshops and allowed pre-college students to perform research. It’s no surprise that since the National Science Foundation announced the dismantling of the Arecibo Observatory, the hashtag #WhatAreciboMeansToMe has seen hundreds of entries on Twitter. Statements like “definitely influenced me to pursue a career in the STEM field,” “Arecibo is the reason I am even in astronomy,” “Arecibo means dreams, goals, inspiration…,” “it was where I saw that a degree in electrical engineering doesn’t have to lead to building weapons,” and “people do not imagine the influence that Arecibo has not only in science, but to aspiring scientists like me” are among the eulogies being posted for our beloved Arecibo. #WhatAreciboMeansToMe: More than a telescope, Arecibo is the reason I am even in astronomy, and has had an incalculable impact in the communities of PR. A thread 🧵. pic.twitter.com/GOFGXAlQ3o — Kevin Ortiz Ceballos 🇵🇷 (@kortizceballos) November 19, 2020  Images of the Arecibo Observatory will always be around, obviously, even after the radio telescope’s  collapse. One particularly unusual one is contained in the Arecibo Message on its way to globular star cluster M13 at the edge of the Milky Way galaxy. In addition to the simple pictorial image of Arecibo, the binary message also contains a stick figure of a human, the DNA double-helix, and our solar system. To think that the Arecibo Message, designed by Cornell University astronomer Frank Drake with the assistance of Carl Sagan and the Arecibo Observatory staff, was beamed directly from Puerto Rico’s humble countryside to any extraterrestrial intelligent life has always been a source of wonder. #WhatAreciboMeansToMe More than a telescope, Arecibo means dreams, goals, inspiration… I refuse to think that this will be the end. It is very important for many researchers.

I volunteered my personal computer’s idle processing time so that the SETI program—Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence—could attempt to decode possible transmissions from any other intelligent civilizations in our galaxy that were being monitored at the Arecibo Observatory. Puerto Rico has been through a very difficult stretch over the last several years. A prolonged economic downturn, a catastrophic hurricane, political upheaval, a damaging earthquake swarm, a pandemic, and now the loss of our world-renowned source of scientific pride. It is my sincere hope that youngsters on and off the island will find inspiration elsewhere in so many other present and future scientific advancements and technological achievements. Puerto Rico, the United States as a whole, and the world, would all benefit from more inspirational scientific endeavors such as the Arecibo Observatory, that can help guide us to a safer, sustainable, and more just place.

300,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-kerry-climate-dirty-secrets-decarbonization-rebecca-grant,Fox,Towards Right,"Former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Messina provides insight on ‘America’s Newsroom.’ On Friday, President Joe Biden pledged climate action at the virtual G7 and teased an upcoming major summit on Earth Day, April 22, 2021.    Deep decarbonization is what Team Biden wants – the complete end of carbon fuel for electricity, cars, trucks and industrial production. Major economies must ""chart a path to deep decarbonization,"" former Secretary of State John Kerry, who is special presidential envoy for climate, said Jan. 21. It’s all about finding another way to power our planet.  What’s that add up to? According to Kerry, the U.S. must phase out coal five times faster, phase in renewables six times faster, and bring in electric vehicles 22 times faster. Oh my.    JUSTIN HASKIINS: TEXAS ENERGY CRISIS – AOC, GREEN NEW DEAL TO THE RESCUE? HERE'S THE TRUTH I love trees and rivers and clean air. But realize, there are dirty secrets behind this all-out drive to decarbonization. Here are five.    1. Wind and Solar Can’t Meet US Electricity Demand Now or in 2050    On Feb. 8, the Department of Energy projected that coal and natural gas will still contribute nearly 40% of U.S. electricity generation in 2050. Wind and solar power will increase but they aren’t ready to meet the huge demand for electricity without fossil fuels and nuclear power in the mix.    2. China’s Not Ready to Go Green and is Still Building Coal-Fired Electricity Plants  China is the world’s biggest polluter.  China generates 28% of the planet’s yearly carbon dioxide emissions and won’t even start to cut back carbon emissions until 2030.   Yes, Xi Jinping has a plan to get China to net-zero emissions in 2060, 10 years after everyone else. However, China’s plan starts with increasing carbon emissions for 10 years, then radically scaling back. Huh? Fact is, China can’t slack off economic growth. Even down the road, China’s plan won’t stop all emissions, it just includes a lot of offsets from carbon capture and planting trees.    In my opinion, it would be easier to verify a nuclear arms control agreement (which China won’t join) than to track China’s true status on greenhouse gas emissions.  3. Biden Ordered the Military to Tackle the Climate Crisis  Speaking of national security, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin declared ""climate considerations"" an essential element of national security on Jan. 27. The military has already dabbled in clean energy. You’ll find solar panels on military bases, and the U.S Air Force got a green fuel award for flying a B-52 bomber with synthetic fuel in 2006.   I fear Team Biden is exploiting our genuine love for our environment in the USA to push an agenda that could hurt Americans.  What’s new is that Team Biden wants sweeping involvement by the military and perhaps more important, the defense budget involved in climate change technology experiments. Austin’s directive covers everything from climate risk in wargames to overall defense strategy. Scary stuff, given the slate of national security threats from China, Russia, Iran and others.    4. Clean Energy Is Big Business, If the Fossil Fuel Gang Can Be Pushed Aside  Global investment in renewables will exceed $10 trillion through midcentury, said Kerry. Sadly, the hype around the Paris climate accords covers up the brawl between fossil fuels and renewables. Team Biden is directing U.S. government money away from ""carbon"" coal, oil and gas to renewables. The Jan. 27 White House climate directive orders federal funding not to directly subsidize fossil fuels.    It’s complicated, but renewable energy isn’t big enough or efficient enough to dominate the market itself yet, so it needs help. It requires tax incentives such as wind power production tax credits, recently extended by Congress. Your tax dollars are the only way to make ""clean"" energy cheaper right now.    CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER 5. Pushing Wall Street Money to Renewables  Despite all this, it’s no secret that Kerry wants Wall Street money committed to climate goals.  Kerry has for years rallied Wall Street investors like Citigroup and Goldman Sachs to green energy. The recent climate policy actions by the White House plus the slew of incentives already in place aim to stimulate market demand for renewables. When you consider that Berkshire Hathaway owns 7% of the wind turbines in the U.S., it’s probably too late to stop this juggernaut. All that cash from globalization has to go somewhere.  While I’m skeptical of Team Biden’s motives, there’s no doubt that most Americans really care about the environment and worry about climate change. I fear Team Biden is exploiting our genuine love for our environment in the USA to push an agenda that could hurt Americans.  Why can’t Team Biden put some passion into longstanding problems, like cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay? Environmental action is hard, expensive work and many at the state and local level are striving to enact policies that keep tree cover and cherish watersheds.    CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As a senator, Biden preserved an exquisite piece of Delaware shoreline at Cape Henlopen State Park. I wish his administration would force more Chesapeake Bay cleanup, which involves tough action by Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia.    You’d think Team Biden could pull that off.

302,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-revives-obama-policies-hurts-americans-michael-goodwin,Fox,Towards Right,"Former Acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell says on 'Your World' Iran showed it could bully the Biden administration early on. As winners never fail to remind losers, elections have consequences. But rarely is there a  single day where consequences pack as much wallop as Friday, where the irrationality of Joe Biden’s policies came into full view. From the border with Mexico, where the new administration started opening the doors to at least 25,000 migrants seeking asylum, to the Mideast tinderbox, where it moved to rejoin the misbegotten Iran nuke deal, the new president appears fixated by the desire to turn back the clock to 2016. It’s as if Biden has been seized by a sentimental longing to try to make the world like it was when the Obama-Biden administration left office. Unfortunately, ""The Way We Were"" is a nice song but not much of a guide to the future. FRED FLEITZ: IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL – BIDEN RUSHING AHEAD FOR THESE 3 TROUBLING REASONS Still, trying to recapture the past would be reasonable if those years had created prosperity at home and peace abroad. In fact, the world ­Donald Trump inherited was brist­ling with trouble and America’s economy was moving forward at a snail’s pace. Despite revisionist efforts by the media and the left to erase the achievements of the president they hated, Trump had major policy successes that benefited all Americans. It’s especially unnerving, then, that Biden is choosing to reverse the very policies that produced those benefits.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Trump Derangement Syndrome leads people to do weird things, but Biden’s attempt to cancel Trump’s biggest victories is among the weirdest.  The migrant admittances, through a border crossing in San Diego, came after Biden scrapped his predecessor’s policy of having asylum-seekers wait in Mexico. The ""Remain in Mexico"" program was an effective solution to the endless stream of caravans of Central Americans that moved north to escape violence and find work in a booming U.S.  The Obama-Biden policy had been to admit the asylum applicants and turn them loose pending hearings. Naturally, many never showed up because they knew they could not qualify as refugees from persecution. But their ability to stay here illegally served as an incentive for others to follow. Instead of building on the program that reduced mass migrations, Biden returned to the broken system Trump had fixed. Biden also pledges not to build another foot of border wall and pause nearly all ­deportations for 100 days.  In what world does any of that make sense, especially in a pandemic? Something similar happened at the G-7 Security Conference Friday, where Biden abandoned Trump’s America First policy and embraced the ""Kumbaya"" notion that everybody is better off when we ­outsource our interests to globalist institutions.  ""America is back, the transatlantic alliance is back, and we are not looking backward,"" Biden said. He declared that the partnership with Europe is ""the cornerstone of all we hope to accomplish in the 21st century."" Why would Biden trust the untrustworthy Iranians and undo the enormous progress Trump achieved? Although he didn’t mention Trump, Biden went out of his way to distort recent history. ""I know the past few years have strained and tested our transatlantic relationship, but the United States is determined – determined – to reengage with Europe, to consult with you, to earn back our position of trust and leadership,"" he said. In truth, America’s major fight with Europe, especially Germany, was over the failure of NATO members to meet their agreed-upon commitment to spend at least 2% of their GDP for defense. For years, American presidents, including Barack Obama, had made the same complaint and were ignored.  Trump of course cannot be ignored. He loudly questioned the value of the alliance and railed against the fact that America was paying far more than a fair share for the common defense. He also was not amused that NATO spent more than $1.4 billion for a new Brussels headquarters.  Bingo, he succeeded. Most of the deadbeats increased their defense spending, to the tune of more than an additional $100 billion a year, while agreeing to a reduction in U.S. contributions. They remain unhappy but why should Biden care? And why is he such a generous sap with American taxpayers’ money? His plan to rejoin the Iran nuke deal that Trump scuttled is perhaps the looniest idea of all because of the shock waves it sends around the Middle East. The deal didn’t even address, let alone stop, Iran’s military aggression and terror proxies, which the Obama-Biden administration admitted. It also conceded that some of the billions Washington included ended up financing terror. Recall also that the lack of faith in the deal led Saudi Arabia and others to talk of getting their own nukes. Just recently, more evidence confirmed that Iran had a nuclear-weapons program despite its constant denial. After Trump withdrew from the pact, reimposed sanctions and droned Iran terror leader Qasem Soleimani, an odd thing happened. As Democrats, including Biden, were running around like Chicken Littles warning of new wars, four Muslim countries signed historic peace and diplomatic accords with Israel, part of which involve joint security – against Iran. So again questions arise: Why would Biden trust the untrustworthy Iranians and undo the enormous progress Trump achieved? Does he hate Trump more than he loves peace? Before you answer, remember what former Defense Secretary Robert Gates said about Biden: ""I think he has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national-security issue over the past four decades."" Finally, Friday was the day America formally rejoined the Paris climate accord that Trump abandoned.  Soon the White House will push more job-killing restrictions on ­industry and consumer emissions, all while China and India keep ­increasing theirs. But fear not, the intrepid John Kerry is on the case. The private-jet warrior for eliminating greenhouse gases used the occasion to restart the countdown to catastrophe.  ""Well, the scientists told us three years ago we had 12 years to avert the worst consequences of climate crisis,"" he told CBS. ""We are now three years gone, so we have nine years left."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP To underscore that this time is different, Kerry insisted, ""There is no room for BS anymore.

The Trump Organization says its last day of operating the iconic Wollman Rink and the smaller Lasker Rink at the park’s northern end will be Sunday. The rink contracts had been set to expire in April, but Mayor de Blasio has moved to ice Trump out a month early, effective Feb. 26.

The carousel never opened for the season and remains closed due to the pandemic; the golf course closed for the season in December. ""Despite our appeals to the City to allow us to continue operations through the duration of the skating season — which would not only save the jobs of nearly 250 individuals who work or otherwise provide services Wollman and Lasker Rinks, but also allow us to continue to provide the numerous public skating sessions and skating and hockey programs that we host on a daily basis — the City rejected our efforts,"" the Trump Organization told The Post in a statement. Executive Vice President Eric Trump, the former commander in chief’s son, slammed de Blasio for being ""petty"" in ending the contracts, and said he was saddened that kids would be kept off the ice. ""The city is saying in effect, ‘We don’t care if it destroys the skating season; we want you out now,'"" Trump told The Post.

With support from partner Castrol, RFR became the first carbon neutral team in NASCAR. Roush Fenway on Thursday announced its carbon neutrality certification according to the PAS 2060 standard, verified by independent third party ERM CVS. Roush reached the status throughout its entire organization, including operations and its two race teams, for 2020.

It created a clean look that symbolizes the minimalistic path to carbon neutrality. Castrol in its sponsorship negotiations with RFR mandated a contract clause that the team work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and offset the balance. ""We've spent months tracking, quantifying, measuring our existing carbon footprint and ways to reduce our carbon footprint,"" RFR President Steve Newmark said. ""There's no doubt that we have unavoidable carbon emissions in how we operate our business. When you race cars and travel around the country to do so, that will inevitably be part of our operations. ""We're trying to show that even companies in an industry like ours can take steps to reduce overall emissions, and, our hope is that it will set an example for other teams and the racing industry."" To become carbon neutral, RFR set a goal to recycle 90% of every race car, including oil, rubber, aluminum and carbon fiber.

BlackRock has been dubbed the ""world’s largest investor in deforestation"" by Amazon Watch. According to Amazon Watch, BlackRock, in charge of nearly $8.7 trillion in assets, is among the top three shareholders of the world’s 25 largest publicly listed deforestation-risk companies.  The White House could not be reached for comment on Deese's record with BlackRock. DEESE SAYS US AT 'MOMENT THAT REQUIRES DECISIVE ACTION' WITH COVID  A Daily Beast report found that during Deese’s 2017 to 2020 tenure, the BlackRock maintained or increased holdings widely blamed for plowing down South America’s forested regions, including one company co-owned by the Brazilian government. President Biden has threatened that government with sanctions if it does not do more to protect its rainforests.  The main sources of BlackRock’s ties to deforestation are investments in pulp, paper and palm oil companies, along with beef, rubber and timber. BlackRock’s investment in deforestation-risk commodities increased by more than half a billion dollars between 2014 and 2018.  At BlackRock, Deese, as Global Head of Sustainability worked ""identifying drivers of long-term return associated with environmental, social and governance issues, integrating them throughout BlackRock's investment processes, and creating solutions for our clients to achieve sustainable investment return.""  BRIAN DEESE: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT BIDEN'S NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR  In interviews, Deese explained his team’s role was to determine whether a company ran financial risks related to climate change or natural resource mismanagement and to incorporate those risks into BlackRock's investment strategy. In December, Amazon Watch and other activist groups penned a letter calling on Deese to outline his plan for environmental racial justice, given his background. ""We agree with the President-elect that naming someone as NEC Director with a clear record of climate change policy and a commitment to racial justice is necessary. However, your most recent experience working for BlackRock raises concerns over conflicts of interest,"" they wrote.

310,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-texas-green-new-deal-climate-catastrophe,Fox,Towards Right,"'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host slams the Green New Deal after a winter storm freezes Texas wind turbines The Green New Deal has come, believe it or not, to the state of Texas. How's it working out so far? Well, the good news is all that alternative energy seems to have had a remarkable effect on the climate. Sunday night, parts of Texas got the temperatures that we typically see in Alaska. In fact, they were the same as they were in Alaska. So global warming is no longer a pressing concern in Houston.  The bad news is, they don't have electricity. The windmills froze, so the power grid failed. Millions of Texans woke up Monday morning having to boil their water because with no electricity, it couldn't be purified. The ironically named Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which oversees the grid, had no solution to any of this. They simply told people to stop using so much power to keep warm. So in Houston, hundreds of shivering Texans headed to the convention center like refugees to keep from freezing to death. Some Texans almost certainly did freeze to death. Later this week, we'll likely learn just how many more were killed as they tried to keep warm with jury-rigged heaters and barbecues and car exhaust. DEADLY TEXAS WINTER STORM LEAVES MILLIONS WITHOUT POWER AMID FRIGID TEMPERATURES That happens every time when the power goes out; even advanced societies become primitive and dangerous, and people die. We've seen it happen repeatedly in California for years now, rolling blackouts in a purportedly First World state that is slipping steadily into chaos. But who saw that coming in Texas? If there's one thing you would think Texas would be able to do, it's keep the lights on. Most electricity comes from natural gas and Texas produces more of that than any place on the continent. There are huge natural gas deposits all over the state. Running out of energy in Texas is like starving to death at the grocery store: You can only do it on purpose, and Texas did. Rather than celebrate and benefit from their state's vast natural resources, politicians took the fashionable route and became recklessly reliant on so-called alternative energy, meaning windmills. Fifteen years ago, there were virtually no wind farms in Texas. Last year, roughly a quarter of all electricity generated in the state came from wind. Local politicians were pleased by this. They bragged about it like there was something virtuous about destroying the landscape and degrading the power grid. Just last week, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott proudly accepted something called the Wind Leadership Award, given with gratitude by Tri Global Energy, a company getting rich from green energy. So it was all working great until the day it got cold outside. The windmills failed like the silly fashion accessories they are, and people in Texas died. This is not to beat up on the state of Texas -- it's a great state, actually -- but to give you some sense of what's about to happen to you. BIDEN EXECUTIVE ORDER WANTS STUDY ON RESETTLING THOSE 'DISPLACED' BY CLIMATE CHANGE Here's President Biden last month: BIDEN, JAN. 27: In my view, we’ve already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis ... That’s why I’m signing today an executive order to supercharge our administration['s] ambitious plan to confront the existential threat of climate change.  And it is an existential threat.  ""Climate crisis"", ""existential threat"", ""ambitious plan"". You hear those phrases a lot and you'll notice that they are all suspiciously non-precise. So what do they mean for you? Will they mean higher energy prices? For starters, gas prices are already up, in case you haven't noticed. Electricity will follow. Higher costs hurt the weakest, inflation always does, but it's worse than that. Green energy inevitably means blackouts. Someday that may change as technology progresses, but as of right now and given the current state of technology, green energy means a less reliable power grid. It means failures like the ones we're seeing now in Texas. That's not a talking point, that is true. It's science. So of course, they're denying it. Here's our new climate czar taking a quick break from spewing carbon in his private jet to lecture the rest of us about a topic he personally knows nothing about: Private sector jobs and how more windmills are going to generate tons of them: KERRY'S PRIVATE JET USE SHOWS HOW HARD IT IS TO ACTUALLY CUT EMISSIONS: CLIMATE AUTHOR JOHN KERRY, JAN. 27:  The president of the United States has expressed in every comment he has made about climate the need to grow the new jobs that pay better, that are cleaner than -- I mean, you know, you look at the consequences of black lung for a miner, for instance, and measure that against the fastest growing job in the United States before COVID [which] was solar power technician ... And similarly, you have the second fastest-growing job pre-COVID was wind turbine technician. This is happening. The old plan, you'll remember, was coding. All the guys in pickup trucks were going to learn to code and run the Internet after we sent their jobs to China. In the end, of course, we just imported people from China to code, so that didn't actually happen. But John Kerry has another idea: High school-educated rural people are going to be wind turbine technicians. So what they used to do with transmissions, whatever that was, they're going to do with windmills; put bearings in them or lube them or something. Now, it's possible that John Kerry actually believes that. Maybe he's never been within 20 feet of a wind turbine. He definitely doesn't live near one. They don't have wind farms in Aspen or Martha's Vineyard and they're not getting them. John Kerry himself once fought to keep wind farms out of sight of his summer house on Nantucket. That's hypocritical, but it's not surprising. People who support wind farms, as a rule, live very far from wind farms. People who live near wind farms have a totally different view, and why wouldn't they? How would you like a massive power plant in your backyard humming and buzzing and chopping up birds? That's what a wind turbine is. If you're ever in rural America, go see one for yourself. You'll be shocked by how awful it is once you get up close. Your first thought may be, ""This is supposed to be good for the environment."" Wind farms are one of those ideas you can only support if you don't know too much about them, and maybe that's why there's never been mass popular support for them.  No large group of citizens has ever demanded that some Goldman Sachs company destroy the natural environment with Chinese-made windmills that don't work when it's cold out. Wait, more expensive and much less reliable? Ugly, inefficient and made by people who hate us? And we can kill endangered species? I'd like some of that. In fact, make it a double. No one anywhere has ever said that, but it doesn't matter because green energy is the ultimate inside game. A tiny number of people profit from it due to government subsidies and regulated prices. Everyone else gets a moral lecture about climate change and anyone who complains about any of it gets called a Nazi by Cory Booker. The problem is that demagogues like Cory Booker have no earthly idea what a wind farm is. They don't know how to run a power grid, or anything else, for that matter. They talk, they brag, but they don't build anything, much less fix or maintain it. They can't, they have no skills. If you don't believe that, take a look at what they have done to our cities. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Not a single major American city is prettier or more functional than it was in 1950. The parks that previous generations so lovingly built are filled with vagrants and junkies. The monuments they constructed are covered with spray paint. Public transportation is a disgrace. It's filthy, the streets are dangerous. Are you really surprised that Cory Booker was once the mayor of Newark, N.J.? You shouldn't be. Cory Booker couldn't fix your ice maker, much less understand your wind farm. None of these people can.

The New York State Assembly advanced a bill Wednesday to rename Donald J. Trump State Park. The Empire State's tourism committee voted 14-7 to move forward with the legislation. Democratic Assemblywoman Nily Rozic first introduced the issue four years ago in a bill where she proposed to rename the park after Heather Heyer, who was killed in 2017 when a man drove a car into a crowd protesting a White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va. NATIONAL PARKS SERVICE BEGINS CORONAVIRUS MASK MANDATE ON LANDS, FEDERAL BUILDINGS ""Our parklands should be reflective of New Yorkers that we can be proud of, New Yorkers that have expressed our values,"" Rozic told Politico. ""There are a lot of other New Yorkers who are worthy of the honor of having a park named after themselves."" Notably, Democratic state Sen. Brad Hoylman brought forward a similar measure in 2020. The 430-acre park on the border of Putnam and Westchester counties has sat largely underutilized since its namesake donated the land in 2006, initially intending to build a championship golf course when he bought the parcels in 1998. An agreement signed in 2006 conditions that Donald Trump's name be ""prominently displayed at least at each entrance to each property."" Then-Gov. George Pataki announced the donation in a statement and Trump said the park was his way of ""trying to give back"" and that he hoped the park would ""turn into one of the most beautiful parks anywhere in the world."" In 2016, Pataki told Time Warner Cable's ""Capital Tonight"" that he was ""unhappy"" the 45th president's name was attached to the property, to which Trump told the Associated Press: ""If they want, they can give me the land back."" There was also controversy surrounding the purchase and transfer of the ""passive park.""

       The Queens native originally bought the undeveloped, protected land for more than $2.7 million, but met resistance by local opposition in part due to environmental laws related to a nearby reservoir. It was then that Trump made the move to donate the land to the state -- managing to get the same property reappraised at a value of more than $26 million -- and receiving a tax write-off in the process. Time reported in 2019 that the state stopped tending to the park in 2010 -- angering Trump -- which notably has few amenities or paths to maintain.  The state's commissioner of parks, recreation and historic preservation, Erik Kulleseid, told lawmakers at a budget hearing last month that he was ""evaluating"" the 2006 agreement, he had received messages about rebranding the park and that Trump's request to keep his name on the property is not in the deed for the donation.  Tourism Committee Chair Danny O'Donnell told Politico that he doesn't foresee any legal challenges from Trump in changing the name. ""I don’t think [Trump] will have the resources to care when the time comes,"" he said. ""But maybe he would; he’s sufficiently a narcissist."" ""In 2006, President Donald J. Trump donated in excess of 430 acres of land in Westchester and Putnam counties to the State of New York so that a park could be created for the enjoyment of all NY State's citizens,"" a Trump Organization spokesperson told Fox News on Thursday. ""Despite the fact that the State has done a horrible job running and maintaining the park in question, an utter disgrace to such incredible land and a generous donation, the conditions of this gift, formally documented and accepted by the State of New York, could not be clearer: the park must bear President Trump’s name.

Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com. After years of delays and a federal review, construction on the planned $500 million Obama Presidential Center will begin later this year in Chicago, officials said Wednesday. The largely privately financed construction is expected to take about four years to complete, with taxpayers expected to pick up the tab for an estimated $174 million in related roadway changes, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. The planned project has faced complaints from residents in the city’s South Side neighborhood, who have argued that the facility – to be composed of a public library and other features – would displace some of the area’s Black residents. Others opposed planned changes to Jackson Park, the 540-acre recreation area that will host the 19-acre center, the Sun-Times reported. Jackson Park is listed on the National Register of Historic Places because it was a site of the 1893 Columbian Exposition and was designed by famed architects Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, according to the newspaper.

Community objections include opposition to a $5 million branding deal with Nike to fund the center's athletic facility, according to the Chicago Reporter. Those potential obstacles weren’t addressed in a video message released Wednesday by Barack Obama, the nation’s 44th president. ""Getting to this point wouldn’t have been possible without the folks in the community who have been a part of this process along the way,"" Obama said. ""We know that by working together, we can unlock the South Side’s fullest potential – and help set up our city, our country and our world for even better years to come."" Site preparation, including the rerouting of sewer, water and electricity lines, will begin in April, with construction set to get underway in August, officials with the Obama Foundation said, according to the Associated Press. A groundbreaking will likely take place in the early fall, Lori Healey, who is overseeing the project, told the Sun-Times. The multi-building project, planned for a 19-acre portion of Jackson Park, will include a museum, public library, athletic center, children’s playground and test kitchen, the AP reported. It is being financed through private donations, with the Obama Foundation also pledging to donate up to $3.5 million for a public facility for track and field competitions. It will not include a formal ""presidential library"" because Obama did not want to deal with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) rules that would apply to such a designation, the Sun-Times reported. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot celebrated the news about the next stage in developing the center. ""With this final step in the review, Chicago is now officially the home of the presidential center for our country’s first Black president,"" Lightfoot said in a statement.

""The fact that we are finally treating it as an emergency, and we finally have leadership, it’s truly an exciting moment, Ali,"" Betsy Rosenberg told MSNBC's Ali Velshi Saturday. ""It’s epic, it’s like a week of climate climaxing.

Velshi chuckled and said, ""That was a different expression than I was going to use,"" before pivoting the conversation to General Motors' promise this week to offer only zero-emissions vehicles by 2035.  BIDEN HAS SIGNED 40 EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND ACTIONS SINCE TAKING OFFICE One of President Biden's first actions after being inaugurated was to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, an international treaty that aims to roll back greenhouse gas emmissions.  President Biden also revoked the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day in office. On Wednesday, the President reestablished the council on science, technology, and innovation that will advise him on environmental issues, and signed a sweeping executive order to tackle the ""climate crisis at home and abroad."" ""We have a narrow moment to pursue action at home and abroad in order to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of that crisis and to seize the opportunity that tackling climate change presents,"" the executive order reads. ""Domestic action must go hand in hand with United States international leadership, aimed at significantly enhancing global action."" PSAKI HOLDS WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING WITH JOHN KERRY, GINA MCCARTHY ON BIDEN CLIMATE ORDERS Biden's early reliance on executive orders has been heavily criticized by some, though his team has mostly brushed off the scrutiny.  ""Of course we are also pursuing our agenda through legislation,"" White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield tweeted Thursday. ""It’s why we are working so hard to get the American Rescue Plan passed, for starters!"" Despite the criticisms, Biden's executive orders have been praised by many as necessary at a time when Congress is deadlocked.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""We have to change our whole economy and greenify it,"" Rosenberg told MSNBC Saturday. ""It's really a matter of expanding our thinking.

321,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/john-kerry-family-private-jet-emissions,Fox,Towards Right,"John Kerry, special presidential envoy for climate, called out for family's private jet while stressing the need for America to act on carbon emissions. Reaction from Fox News contributor Joe Concha. Data compiled by the flight tracking firm FlightAware and obtained by Fox News show that John Kerry's family Gulfstream GIV-SP spent around 22 hours and 22 minutes in the air over the past year. Using Paramount Business Jets emissions calculator, Fox News found that Kerry's planed accumulated an estimated 116 metric tons of carbon between trips dating from Feb. 9, 2020, to Jan. 10, 2021.  For comparison, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that the typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. That calculation assumed a car that drives around 11,500 miles per year with a fuel economy of about 22.0 miles per gallon. JOHN KERRY'S FAMILY STILL OWNS PRIVATE JET AS HE LEADS CLIMATE FIGHT, FAA RECORDS INDICATE As Fox News previously noted, the Kerry family owned a private charter jet company that the longtime Democratic politician appeared to benefit from financially. As late as 2013, his executive branch personnel financial disclosure showed Kerry owning ""over $1,000,001"" in assets for the charter company Flying Squirrel LLC through his wife. Kerry's financial disclosures from 2009-2012 also show that amount. In his 2013 disclosure, the former secretary of state reported between ""$50,001-$100,000"" in rent and royalties for the company. That figure was over $1 million in his 2012 form and between $100,001-$1,000,000 for 2013. Other disclosures show rental income of over $1 million for 2011, ""$100,001-$1,000,000"" for 2010, and ""$100,001-$1,000,000"" for 2008. Private jets have been estimated to emit upward of 40 times as much carbon per passenger as commercial flights. The emissions estimate comes as Democrats consider massive proposals for overhauling the nation's energy economy with potentially skyrocketing costs for households and individual Americans. President Biden's climate proposal would cost at least $1.7 trillion. That could grow, however, depending on how Democrats negotiate with him in Congress, where progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., have been adamant about passing the ambitious Green New Deal. During the campaign, Biden said he would use the Green New Deal as a framework for his climate plan, although his proposal cost significantly less than other plans that adopted that framework. Regardless, Biden's plan aims for the type of economy-wide transformation advocated by more left-leaning members of his party. KERRY VOWS TO TREAT CLIMATE CHANGE AS 'URGENT NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT' That included achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, which the Heritage Foundation has said would cost the economy millions of jobs, thousands of dollars in lost household income, and trillions erased from the nation's gross domestic product. The conservative nonprofit used the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) National Energy Model to forecast the impact of steep carbon taxes aimed at reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. Not only did the model crash, it failed to approach anywhere near the goal outlined in the ""GND."" The closest Heritage was able to get was a 58% reduction in emissions, achieved through a $300 carbon tax  -- taxes above $300 crashed the EIA's model. They estimated that just a 58 percent reduction would, by 2040, cost the economy $15 trillion in lost gross domestic product and an average of 1.1 million jobs per year. The average family of four would also see a total income loss of $165,000, or nearly $8,000 each year. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. and Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., maintain that the cost of inaction on climate change is unsustainable. According to Sanders, solutions like infrastructure and investment would boost the U.S. economy as well. Biden's campaign website predicted his climate response could create 10 million ""well-paying jobs."" Sanders previously warned that without action on climate change, the U.S. would ""lose $34.5 trillion by the end of the century."" He also predicted savings as high as $70.4 trillion over 80 years by ""averting climate catastrophe."" The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

 President Joe Biden signed three executive orders on climate change Wednesday, vowing to put the issue ""at the center"" of U.S. national security and domestic and foreign policy. The executive action follows his decision to shut down construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which was expected to sustain about 11,000 U.S. jobs in 2021 and generate $1.6 billion in gross wages. Prior to signing the orders, Biden kicked-off his press briefing by saying ""Today is climate day at the White House, which means that today is jobs day at the White House.""  Neal Crabtree, 46, was among the first of the U.S. workers impacted by the new administration’s aggressive approach to fighting climate change.

Biden signed new executive actions to eliminate federal subsidies for oil and other fossil fuels and halt new oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters. His Wednesday action also commits to conserving at least 30 percent of federal lands and waters by 2030 and to double renewable energy production from wind by 2030. ""It's a full-out assault on the oil and gas industry -- on the 10 million people in the United States who work in the industry [and] the 2 million Texans,"" GOP Rep.

He blasted Biden's ""gross overreach"" from the Oval Office to issue orders that he said will cost jobs, raise energy prices and take a big step backward on American energy independence.  ""Energy security equals national security,"" Pfluger said. ""This is weakening our national security. I mean for the first time in decades, we were energy independent at the end of 2019, beginning of 2020. And when you export more than you import and you're not dependent on foreign countries for your own energy needs, that's a lever of national security.""

For the first time in nearly a decade, Democrats control the Senate, House and White House. But most legislation still has to pass the 60-vote hurdle.

330,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/environment-biden-energy-justin-haskins,Fox,Towards Right,"ClimateDepot.com Executive Editor Marc Morano reacts to the president’s executive orders on climate and discusses how they could affect the economy. President Biden has quickly and dramatically reset the priorities of the federal government. On his first day in office he sent a clear message to the American people: pursuing radical environmental policies matters more to him than helping poor and working-class families. Just hours after entering the White House, Biden signed 17 executive actions into law, including an order to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement and another to revoke the construction permit needed to continue work on the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Both actions will have far-reaching and tremendously harmful economic consequences for nearly all Americans, but especially those living paycheck to paycheck. That’s because energy costs and basic consumer goods make up a greater proportion of household spending for low-income families than for those earning more. JUSTIN TRUDEAU ‘DISAPPOINTED’ IN BIDEN'S DECISION TO CANCEL KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE By reentering the Paris Climate Agreement, Biden has pledged that by 2030 the U.S. will reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 30% below 2005 levels — a reduction that will require shutting down numerous existing power plants, as well as oil, natural gas, and coal operations. Hitting this target, which is actually quite modest compared to the other targets included in Biden’s full climate platform, would have an incredibly detrimental impact on the economy, costing hundreds of thousands of jobs and raising energy prices to sky-high levels. The reason reentering the Paris Climate Agreement is so harmful to the economy is because the Biden administration aims to meet the Paris targets by requiring Americans to rely more on new wind and solar energy facilities, which are less reliable and much more expensive than existing energy sources. The Heritage Foundation’s Nick Loris estimates that if the United States were to meet the targets contained in the Paris Climate Agreement, the average American family of four would, over two decades, pay $30,000 more in higher energy costs — which is about as much as many people pay for a new car. These higher costs are particularly harmful to low-income families. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports that ""research has indicated that low-income households decrease the amount of food they buy in response to an increase in prices for gasoline, natural gas, and electricity."" Loris also estimates the U.S. economy will have 400,000 fewer jobs, about half of which are related to manufacturing. Because energy prices affect virtually every part of the economy, nearly every business will be harmed by Biden’s energy policies. Loris projects the total gross domestic product lost by attempting to hit the Paris targets would be greater than $2.5 trillion — and again, that’s just to meet the Paris goals, not the Biden administration’s much more ambitious target of having the entire U.S. electric grid be 100% carbon dioxide-neutral by 2035. No one knows how many of the roughly 1.5 million American families with someone working  in the oil and gas industries will still be getting paychecks by the time the Biden administration is done enacting the far-left’s environmental agenda. In fact, some Americans have already lost important economic opportunities as a result of Biden’s climate and energy plans. After word got out that the Biden administration decided to kill the Keystone XL project — an expansion of a pipeline bringing oil from Alberta, Canada to U.S. refineries — TC Energy, the firm working to construct the pipeline, announced it will lay off 1,000 workers. By stopping the Keystone XL pipeline, the Biden administration also killed more than 10,000 union jobs expected to be created throughout the pipeline’s development, as well as tens of thousands of additional jobs related to the project. All told, TC Energy projects the construction of the pipeline would ""support nearly 60,000 (U.S., 42,000 and Canada, 17,000) direct, indirect and induced employment opportunities generated by the business that will be created supplying goods and services to the project and the project’s workforce."" In stopping the Keystone XL pipeline, President Biden likely made history. I can find no record of another American president who so willingly and deliberately destroyed more than 40,000 job opportunities on his first day in office, never mind shutting down a project expected to result in billions of dollars in new economic opportunities. Many of these jobs were expected to be union jobs, which is why many labor unions supported construction of the pipeline. This makes Biden’s action even more astounding, since he presented himself on the campaign trail as a champion of union laborers. Biden has justified his environmental policies by repeatedly claiming they are needed to battle climate change, which he says presents an ""existential threat"" to human life. That’s a totally ridiculous assertion unsupported by the available scientific evidence. But even if you believe carbon dioxide emissions are the primary driver of climate change and that climate change is going to be catastrophic to life on Earth — a position held by only a minority of U.S. voters — it’s important to keep in mind that numerous reports have found that the Keystone XL pipeline would have no substantial impact on global carbon dioxide emissions. Even the Obama administration’s own State Department concluded in five separate reports that carbon dioxide emissions would not increase because of the pipeline. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Worse still, there’s no evidence that cutting U.S. carbon dioxide emissions would reduce global temperature in the long run. This is true regardless of what you believe about the role carbon dioxide emissions play in causing global warming. That’s because many of the world’s largest emitters are projected to increase their use of energy sources that produce substantial amounts of carbon dioxide emissions from coal and other sources over the next few decades to more than offset any cuts made in the United States. China, for example, ""has nearly 250 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired power now under development, more than the entire coal power capacity of the United States,"" according to a June report by Reuters. Why, then, was Biden so eager to eliminate billions of dollars in new economic development and tens of thousands of new jobs? And why are the new president and his administration working so hard to promote policies that will lead to higher energy prices that will hurt the poor most of all? CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The only reasonable explanation is that pleasing the far-left wing of the Democratic Party —which seems more than willing to dismantle as many jobs as it takes to push the country toward costly and unreliable wind and solar energy — is more important to Biden than the interests of low-income and working-class Americans. It’s a sad assertion, to be sure, but it is the only conceivable explanation for the reckless actions of President Biden in just his first week in office.

But McConnell also reminded Biden and the slim Democratic Senate majority that Americans voted to keep a split Senate, with 50 Republicans and 50 Democrats, which means Republicans intend to challenge policies they believe will have negative impacts on their constituents. ""If and when our Democratic friends depart from common sense, when they retreat from common ground, when their proposals would harm the common good – then we’ll use the power the American people have given us to push for what is right,"" the minority leader said from the floor.  Some congressional Democrats have discussed removing the filibuster, a move McConnell urged senators to rethink.

The move was part of the Biden administration’s broader goal to crack down on fossil fuels. The new president is expected to direct sweeping environmental regulatory changes over the next four years and reverse some Trump-era deregulatory policies in an effort to tackle climate change.  The controversial Keystone XL pipeline initially proposed more than a decade ago, would sustain about 11,000 U.S. jobs in 2021 and generate $1.6 billion in gross wages.

When Joe Biden becomes president of the United States at noon Wednesday he will need bipartisan cooperation to launch his national security policies and get members of his national security team confirmed by the Senate. So far, he hasn’t received it.  But despite the bitterly divisive 2020 election campaign and its aftermath – culminating in the horrific Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol that left five people dead and many law enforcement officers injured – Republicans and Democrats need to work together to protect our national security. There is no other option.   The Sept. 11, 2001, terrorists didn’t single out Democrats or Republicans to murder when they succeeded in killing nearly 3,000 people in our country. Our troops who are killed and wounded in Afghanistan, Iraq and other countries are targeted because they are Americans, not because of their political affiliation. VAN HIPP: RETIRED GEN. LLOYD AUSTIN WOULD BE AN OUTSTANDING DEFENSE SECRETARY IN BIDEN ADMINISTRATION And foreign adversaries plotting future attacks on our country just want to kill as many of us as possible, no matter which political party we support.  Unfortunately, Biden will be the first president in decades not to have any Cabinet-level national security posts confirmed by the Senate on Inauguration Day. This breaks a long tradition of the Senate putting aside partisan rivalries to confirm a new president’s top national security officials by the time he takes office.   CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Even when George W. Bush became the 43rd president after the 2000 election following a Florida recount that ended with a Supreme Court ruling to settle the election, his nominees to head the State Department (Colin Powell) and Defense Department (Donald Rumsfeld) were confirmed on Jan. 20, 2001.  There is plenty of blame to go around for the delays in getting Biden’s national security Cabinet nominees confirmed.   Biden was slow to make some of these nominations. Although the president-elect nominated Antony Blinken as secretary of state Nov. 23, Blinken did not submit his paperwork and financial disclosures until Dec. 31. And Blinken has failed to meet with most members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  There have been similar delays for other Biden national security nominees. While some of these delays are clearly the fault of the Biden transition team and the nominees, Senate Democrats have blamed the delays on foot-dragging by Republican Senate committee chairman.  Senate Republicans must press nominees for top Biden national security posts hard for answers on their national security views and priorities. But Republicans must also cooperate with their Democratic counterparts and the Biden team to get these nominees confirmed so they can start on Inauguration Day or just a few days afterward.  The Senate traditionally gives new presidents considerable leeway to name their national security teams. Although Biden’s nominees are mostly unremarkable former Obama administration officials (except for William Burns, Biden’s outstanding nominee to be CIA director), none of them appear to have serious issues that should prevent their rapid confirmation.   So far, Biden and his advisers have not demonstrated that they understand how serious the threats listed above are to our country. The simple truth is that Biden needs his top national security officials in place ASAP. This is vital for our country, not just for Biden or for Democrats.  America faces a dangerous world, with challenges to our security involving China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Islamist terrorists, cyberwarfare, border security, weapons of mass destruction (including biological weapons) and threats to our economic security.  We need a robust foreign and defense policy under soon-to-be President Biden to address these and other threats.  So far, Biden and his advisers have not demonstrated that they understand how serious the threats listed above are to our country. This is both dangerous and frightening.   The Biden team seems to believe that the most important national security threat facing our nation is climate change. It plans to assign dozens of staff to support Biden’s climate czar John Kerry, who served as President Obama’s secretary of state.   The climate czar – with the official title of ""special presidential envoy on climate change"" – will be part of the National Security Council and answer directly to the new president.   Biden officials will need to explain whether they actually believe climate change is a more serious threat than the nuclear-armed nations of Russia, China, North Korea and nuclear wannabe and terrorist-sponsor Iran. Will the Biden administration favor making security and economic concessions to these nations to win climate agreements?  If terrorist groups like Al Qaeda, ISIS, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah and others announce they are working to fight climate change in addition to fighting the U.S., Israel, and our other allies, will Kerry advocate disastrous concessions to them, as he did when he signed off on the badly flawed Iran nuclear deal?    It is clear that Biden and his aides do not understand how much more dangerous Iran has become since he left office as vice president, due to the Islamic Republic’s belligerent behavior and missile attacks.  In a grave miscalculation, Biden said in December that ""if Iran returns to strict compliance with the nuclear deal, the United States would rejoin the agreement as a starting point for follow-on negotiations.""     Rejoining the nuclear deal would reward Iran’s continued hostile actions – including its support for terrorist groups, vows to wipe Israel off the map, and consistent cheating on the nuclear deal.  Rejoining the Iran nuclear deal – which fails in its basic goal of stopping Iran from eventually developing nuclear weapons – would require the United States to drop President Trump’s strong economic sanctions on Iran. This would provide Iran’s virulently anti-Americans mullahs with billions of dollars to spend on terrorism, missiles, nuclear weapons and meddling in regional crises. Inevitably, this will lead to trouble.    CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Despite the above concerns, however, Republicans in the Senate have a responsibility to allow our incoming president to fill important national security posts – not just Cabinet secretaries, but high-ranking appointees in their departments.  Once the Biden team is in place, Republicans and Democrats with a realistic view of our national security challenges can work to open Biden’s eyes to some of the serious dangers we face and do their best to prevent his focus on climate change from overshadowing the other threats our nation faces from abroad.    CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM FRED FLEITZ","Fred Fleitz: Biden, GOP and Dems must work together on these national security challenges"

LANSING, Mich. – Former Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder was charged Wednesday with willful neglect of duty after an investigation of decisions that left Flint with lead-contaminated water and a regional outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease. The charges, revealed in an online court record, are misdemeanors punishable by up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. The charges are groundbreaking: No governor or former governor in Michigan’s 184-year history had been charged with crimes related to their time in that office, according to the state archivist. ""We believe there is no evidence to support any criminal charges against Gov. Snyder,"" defense attorney Brian Lennon said Wednesday night, adding that state prosecutors still hadn't provided him with any details. Lennon said Tuesday that a criminal case would be ""outrageous."" Snyder and others were scheduled to appear in court Thursday, followed by a news conference by Attorney General Dana Nessel and prosecutors.

       Besides Snyder, a Republican who was governor from 2011 through 2018, charges are expected against other people, including former officials who served as his state health director and as a senior adviser. The alleged offense date is April 25, 2014, when a Snyder-appointed emergency manager who was running the struggling, majority Black city carried out a money-saving decision to use the Flint River for water while a regional pipeline from Lake Huron was under construction. The corrosive water, however, was not treated properly and released lead from old plumbing into homes in one of the worst manmade environmental disasters in U.S. history. Despite desperate pleas from residents holding jugs of discolored, skunky water, the Snyder administration took no significant action until a doctor reported elevated lead levels in children about 18 months later. ""I’m sorry and I will fix it,"" Snyder promised during his 2016 State of the State speech. Authorities counted at least 90 cases of Legionnaires’ disease in Genesee County, including 12 deaths. Some experts found there was not enough chlorine in the water-treatment system to control legionella bacteria, which can trigger a severe form of pneumonia when spread through misting and cooling systems. The disaster made Flint a national symbol of government dereliction, with residents forced to line up for bottled water and parents fearing their children had suffered permanent harm. Lead can damage the brain and nervous system and cause learning and behavior problems. The crisis was highlighted as an example of environmental injustice and racism. More than 9,700 lead service lines at homes have been replaced. Flint's water, which now comes from a Detroit regional agency, gets good marks, although many distrustful residents still use filters.

Fadwa Hammoud subsequently dropped charges in eight pending cases and said the investigation would start over. She said the first team had failed to collect all available evidence. Separately, the state, Flint, a hospital and an engineering firm have agreed to a $641 million settlement with residents over the water crisis, with $600 million coming from Michigan. A judge said she hopes to decide by Jan. 21 whether to grant preliminary approval. Other lawsuits, including one against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, are pending.",Ex.-Michigan Gov.

       The water scandal put Flint, a majority Black city, in the national spotlight. Snyder, a Republican, had been in office two years when the state-appointed managers in the city switched Flint's water supply to the Flint River in 2014 as a cost-saving measure while a pipeline was being built to Lake Huron. Residents immediately began complaining of health issues, including hair loss and rashes. In 2015, doctors found dangerous levels of lead in the blood of children and urged the city to stop using water from the river.  The water wasn't treated to reduce corrosion, causing lead from old pipes to reach the distribution system used by residents. Many were forced to resort to bottled water.  The crisis led some to accuse officials of racism.  At the same time, bacteria in the water was blamed for an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease in 2014-15. The outbreak caused several deaths and reports of illness. Legionella bacteria can emerge through misting and cooling systems, triggering a severe form of pneumonia, especially in people with weakened immune systems. Authorities counted at least 90 cases in Genesee County, including 12 deaths.

So the world must make dramatic changes to society, economics and daily life, a new United Nations report says. Unlike past UN reports that focused on one issue and avoided telling leaders actions to take, Thursday’s report combines three intertwined environment crises and tells the world what’s got to change. It calls for changing what governments tax, how nations value economic output, how power is generated, the way people get around, fish and farm, as well as what they eat. “Without nature’s help, we will not thrive or even survive,” Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. “For too long, we have been waging a senseless and suicidal war on nature. The result is three interlinked environmental crises.” Thus the 168-page report title is blunt: “Making Peace With Nature.” “Our children and their children will inherit a world of extreme weather events, sea level rise, a drastic loss of plants and animals, food and water insecurity and increasing likelihood of future pandemics,” said report lead author Sir Robert Watson, who has chaired past UN science reports on climate change and biodiversity loss. “The emergency is in fact more profound than we thought only a few years ago,” said Watson, who has been a top level scientist in the US and British governments. This year “is a make-it or break-it year indeed because the risk of things becoming irreversible is gaining ground every year,” Guterres said. “We are close to the point of no return.” The report highlighted what report co-author Rachel Warren of the University of East Anglia called “a litany of frightening statistics that hasn’t really been brought together:” • Earth is on the way to an additional 3.5 degrees warming from now (1.9 degrees Celsius), far more than the international agreed-upon goals in the Paris accord. • About 9 million people a year die from pollution. • About 1 million of Earth’s 8 million species of plants and animals are threatened with extinction. • Up to 400 million tons of heavy metals, toxic sludge and other industrial waste are dumped into the world’s waters every year. • More than 3 billion people are affected by land degradation and only 15 percent of Earth’s wetlands remain intact. • About 60 percent of fish stocks are fished at the maximum levels. There are more than 400 oxygen-depleted “dead zones” and marine plastics pollution has increased tenfold since 1980. “In the end it will hit us,” said biologist Thomas Lovejoy, who was a scientific advisor to the report. “It’s not what’s happening to elephants. It’s not what’s happening to climate or sea level rise. It’s all going to impact us.” The planet’s problems are so interconnected that they must be worked on together to be fixed right, Warren said. And many of the solutions, such as eliminating fossil fuel use, combat multiple problems including climate change and pollution, she said. The report “makes it clear that there is no time for linear thinking or tackling problems one at a time,” said University of Michigan environment professor Rosina Bierbaum, who wasn’t part of the work. In another break, this report gives specific solutions that it says must be taken. This report uses the word “must” 56 times and “should” 37 times. There should be 100 more because action is so crucial, said former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, who wasn’t part of the report. “Time has totally ran out. That’s why the word ‘must’ is in there,” Figueres said. The report calls for an end to fossil fuel use and says governments should not tax labor or production, but rather use of resources that damages nature. “Governments are still playing more to exploit nature than to protect it,” Guterres said. “Globally, countries spend some 4 to 6 trillion dollars a year on subsidies that damage the environment.” Scientists should inform leaders about environmental risks “but their endorsement of specific public policies threatens to undermine the credibility of their science,” said former Republican Rep. Bob Inglis, who founded the free market climate think tank RepublicEn.org. The report also tells nations to value nature in addition to the gross domestic product when calculating how an economy is doing. Getting there means changes by individuals, governments and business, but it doesn’t have to involve sacrifice, said UN Environment Programme Director Inger Andersen. “There’s a country that has been on that path for 25 years: Costa Rica,” Andersen said. “Yes, these are difficult times, but more and leaders are stepping in.”","UN: Huge changes in society needed to keep nature, Earth OK"
342,https://nypost.com/2021/02/19/us-needs-to-brace-itself-for-more-deadly-storms-experts-say/,NYP,Towards Right,"WASHINGTON — Deadly weather will be hitting the US more often and America needs to get better at dealing with it, experts said as Texas and other states battled winter storms that blew past the worst-case planning of utilities, governments and millions of shivering residents. This week’s storms — with more still heading east — fit a pattern of worsening extremes under climate change and demonstrate anew that local, state and federal officials have failed to do nearly enough to prepare for greater and more dangerous weather. At least two dozen people have died this week, including from fire or carbon monoxide poisoning while struggling to find warmth inside their homes. In Oklahoma City, an Arctic blast plunged temperatures in the state capital as low as 14 degrees below 0 (-25 Celsius). “This is a different kind of storm,″ said Kendra Clements, one of several businesspeople in Oklahoma City who opened their buildings to shelter homeless people, some with frostbite, hypothermia and icicles in their hair. It was also a harbinger of what social service providers and governments say will be a surge of increased needs for society’s most vulnerable as climate and natural disasters worsen. Other Americans are at risk as well. Power supplies of all sorts failed in the extreme cold, including natural gas-fired power plants that were knocked offline amid icy conditions and, to a smaller extent, wind turbines that froze and stopped working. More than 100 million people live in areas under winter weather warnings, watches or advisories and blackouts are expected to continue in some parts of the country for days. The crisis sounded an alarm for power systems throughout the country: As climate change worsens, severe conditions that go beyond historical norms are becoming ever more common. Texas, for example, expects power demand to peak in the heat of summer, not the depths of winter, as it did this week. The dire storms come as President Joe Biden aims to spend up to $2 trillion on infrastructure and clean energy investment over four years. Biden has pledged to update the US power grid to be carbon-pollution free by 2035 as well as weatherize buildings, repair roads and build electric vehicle charging stations. “Building resilient and sustainable infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather and a changing climate will play an integral role” in creating jobs and meeting Biden’s goal of “a net-zero emissions future,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday. The storms are big news this week, especially in light of their effect on COVID-19 vaccinations as well as freezing Americans, but that doesn’t mean they won’t become more common, experts say. “This definitely was an anomaly,″ but one that is likely to occur more frequently as a result of climate change, said Sara Eftekharnejad, assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science at Syracuse University. “There probably needs to be better planning, because we’re starting to see more extreme weather events across the country,″ she said, whether it’s severe cold in Texas or the intense heat wave in California last year that fueled deadly wildfires. Better forecasting — both short-term and long-term — would help avoid catastrophic failures such as the current outages in Texas and other states, as would large-scale storage systems that can supply electricity when demand spikes and a greater diversity of power sources, Eftekharnejad and other experts said. Climate change also is hurting military readiness. Damage from a 2018 hurricane at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida and 2019 flooding at Nebraska’s Offutt Air Force Base, for example, led the Pentagon to send service members as far away as Britain to train. Another 2018 hurricane that hit North Carolina’s Camp Lejeune, home to one-third of the US Marine Corps’ capability, caused enough damage to degrade training overall, senior US military authorities concluded. Hardening military installations against worsening natural disasters will cost trillions. But it has to be done, said Joan VanDervort, a former longtime Defense Department climate expert now with the Center for Climate and Security think tank. “We have eyes overseas that are looking at our vulnerability and seeing how we respond. … There are enemies out there that will certainly take advantage of it.” Michael Craig, an assistant professor of energy systems at the University of Michigan, said the events in California and Texas show that “what we have now is not going to do it in the face of climate change. It’s only going to get worse from here.″ The disaster in Texas and other states “is a reminder that our nation’s critical infrastructure is vulnerable to extreme weather events and we can no longer turn a blind eye to the resiliency investments needed to protect it,″ said Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, who met with Biden at the White House last week. “The cost associated with addressing climate change and improving our infrastructure’s resilience is always going to be less than the cost of rebuilding or failing to act,″ Carper said. Meanwhile, federal regulators are looking into the operations of the bulk-power system during the severe winter storm that affected states from Louisiana to Minnesota. In Texas, where wind power is a growing source of electricity, the wind turbines generally are not equipped to withstand extended low temperatures, as they are in Iowa and other cold-weather states. Modifying the turbines slightly to withstand freezing temperatures is one step needed to confront climate change, said Roy McCann, professor of electrical engineering at the University of Arkansas. While some Republican politicians, including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, have tried to pin blame on wind and solar power for the outages, traditional thermal power plants, which rely mostly on natural gas, provide the bulk of power in the state and were the larger problem. “The entire system was overwhelmed,” said Joshua Rhodes, a research associate on energy issues at the University of Texas.

343,https://nypost.com/2021/02/18/ford-to-go-all-electric-in-europe-by-2030/,NYP,Towards Right,"FRANKFURT, Germany  — Ford is vowing to convert its entire passenger vehicle lineup in Europe to electric power by 2030 in just the latest sign of the seismic technological changes sweeping the auto industry. Ford will spend $1 billion to revamp its factory in Cologne, Germany and make it a base for production of battery powered cars using Volkswagen’s mechanical framework, said Stuart Rowley, president of Ford of Europe, during an online news conference Wednesday. The new electric car is to reach the market in mid-2023 and could be followed by a second one there in the future. The announcement comes just a month after US rival General Motors said its entire global fleet would largely be electric by 2035. Breaking with more than a century of producing internal combustion engines, GM revamped its corporate logo in the likeness of an electric plug. The speed of the transformation at GM and Ford underline a revolution in the auto sector, pushed by regulators seeking to limit emissions. Automakers are simultaneously moving toward digital technology such as smartphone apps and advanced driver assistance systems, with the ultimate goal of fully autonomous vehicles. The agreement with Volkswagen announced Wednesday lets Ford take advantage of VW’s massive investment in electric cars.. The Volkswagen framework uses standard mechanical underpinnings such as the battery, suspension, wheels and axles that can be adjusted to manufacture different vehicle models. Volkswagen is already using the framework in its ID.3 compact and ID.4 sport-utility vehicle. Ford expects two-thirds of its European commercial vehicle sales will be electric or plug-in hybrids by 2030. “We are going all in on electric vehicles,” Rowley said. Carmakers in Europe must sell more electrics to meet new, lower limits on emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas blamed for global warming. The new limit, which took effect at the start of the year, is part of the European Union’s efforts to comply with the 2015 Paris agreement on global warming. If manufacturers don’t hold fleet average emissions below the limit, they face heavy fines. Rowley said Ford was in a position to avoid the fines going forward. The company said commercial vehicles are the key to growth and profitability in Europe, with new products and services through its alliance with Volkswagen and Ford’s Otosan joint venture in Turkey. The investment, to be made through 2025, is among the most significant Ford has made in more than a generation and “underlines our commitment to Europe and a modern future,” Rowley. Ford said the investment in the Cologne plant, which employs just over 4,000 workers, comes after its European operations returned to a profit in the fourth quarter of 2020. The investment is part of Ford’s goal of spending at least $15 billion on electric vehicles from now through 2025.",Ford to go all electric in Europe by 2030

Disha Ravi, 22, was arrested in Bengaluru on Saturday. Police said at a news conference on Monday that the document spread misinformation about the farmer protests on the outskirts of New Delhi and “tarnished the image of India.” Police say Ravi shared the document with Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who tweeted it earlier this month. They say the sharing of the document on social media indicated there was a “conspiracy” behind violence on Jan. 26, India’s Republic Day, when the largely peaceful farmer protests erupted into clashes with police. One protester died and hundreds of police and demonstrators were injured. “The call was to wage economic, social, cultural and regional war against India,” police tweeted on Sunday. Demonstrators Monday in the southern city of Bengaluru, including prominent historian Ramachandra Guha, held placards calling for Ravi’s immediate release. In the western city of Mumbai, around 50 people also demanded that Ravi be freed. Her arrest has been condemned in India and beyond. Opposition parties called her arrest harassment, intimidation and an attack on democracy. Overseas, the niece of US Vice President Kamala Harris, Meena Harris, criticized the government on Twitter for silencing activists. Police also issued arrest warrants for two other activists, Nikita Jacob and Shantanu Muluk, saying the three created the document and shared it with others. Police said the document contained links to websites that were pro-Khalistani, a movement for an independent Sikh homeland called Khalistan in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The government initially tried to discredit the protesting farmers, many of whom are Sikhs, as motivated by religious nationalism. Since November, tens of thousands of farmers have camped outside the capital and blocked highways to protest new agricultural reform laws they say will devastate their incomes. The protests have posed a major challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist-led government, which says the laws are needed to modernize Indian farming. Critics have accused the government of using the massive demonstrations to escalate a crackdown on free speech. The protests attracted international attention earlier this month when pop star Rihanna, Thunberg and Meena Harris tweeted their support. India’s Ministry of External Affairs condemned “vested interest groups trying to enforce their agenda.”",Scores protest in India against arrest of climate activist

346,https://nypost.com/2021/02/09/himalayan-glacier-disaster-highlights-climate-change-risks/,NYP,Towards Right,"NEW DELHI — When Ravi Chopra saw the devastating deluge of water and debris crash downstream from a Himalayan glacier on Sunday, his first thought was that this was exactly the scenario that his team had warned the Indian government of in 2014. At least 31 people have died, 165 people are missing and many are feared to have died. The deluge first smashed into a small dam, gathering more energy as it grew heavier from the debris it collected along the way. Then, it smashed into a larger, under-construction dam and gathered even more energy. Chopra and other experts had been tasked by India’s Supreme Court to study the impact of receding glaciers on dams. They had warned that warming due to climate change was melting the Himalayan glaciers and facilitated avalanches and landslides and that constructing dams in the fragile ecosystem was dangerous. “They were clearly warned and yet they went ahead,” said Chopra, director of the non-profit People’s Science Institute. Scientists had first suspected that a glacial lake had burst Sunday. After examining satellite images, they now believe that a landslide and avalanche were the more likely causes of the disaster. It isn’t clear whether the landslide induced an avalanche of ice and debris, or whether falling ice resulted in the landslide, said Mohammad Farooq Azam, who studies glaciers at the Indian Institute of Technology at Indore. What is known is that mass of rock, boulders, ice and snow came crashing down a 2-kilometer (1.2-mile) near vertical mountain slope on Sunday. And now scientists are trying to figure out if the heat produced due to friction would be enough to melt the snow and ice to result in the flood of water, he said. Experts say that the disaster underscores the fragility of the Himalayan mountains where the lives of millions are being altered by climate change. Even if the world meets its most ambitious climate change targets, rising temperatures will melt away a third of the Himalayan glaciers by the end of the century, a 2019 report by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development found. Himalayan glaciers are melting twice as fast since 2000 as they were in the 25 years before due to human-caused climate change, researchers reported in Science Advances in 2019. Whether this particular disaster was caused by climate change isn’t known. But climate change can increase landslides and avalanches. As glaciers melt due to warming, valleys that were earlier crammed with ice open up, creating space for landslides to move into. In other places, steep mountainous slopes may be partially “glued” together by ice frozen tightly inside its crevices. “As warming occurs and the ice melts, the pieces can move downhill more easily, lubricated by the water,” explained Richard B. Alley, a professor of earth sciences at Pennsylvania State University. With warming, ice is also essentially becoming less frozen: Earlier its temperature would range between minus 6 degrees Celsius to minus 20 C and it it is now minus 2 C (from 21.2 degrees Fahrenheit to minus 4 F earlier to 28.4 F now), said Azam. The ice is still frozen, but is closer to its melting point, so it takes less heat to trigger an avalanche than some decades ago, added Azam. Another threat is that of a glacial lake bursting — what some first suspected was the cause of Sunday’s disaster. The hazard posed by these expanding lakes can’t be ignored, said Joerg Michael Schaefer, a climate scientist who specializes in ice and especially Himalayan glaciers at Columbia University. The water the lakes release into rivers contain the energy equal to “several nuclear bombs” and can provide clean, carbon-free energy through hydropower projects, Schaefer said. But it’s dangerous to set up power plants without looking uphill and mitigating the risk by siphoning water from the lakes to control levels, he said. “The brute force of these things just kind of just really mind blowing,” especially if they break, he said. “You cannot tame that tiger. You have to prevent that.” The Uttarakhand state government said it continually faced “acute power shortage” and was forced to spend $137 million each year to buy electricity, documents submitted to India’s Supreme Court show. The state has the second-highest potential for generating hydropower in India, but experts say that solar energy and wind energy offered more sustainable and less risky alternatives in the long-run. Development was needed for the upliftment of the impoverished region, but experts said such projects should take into account the ecological fragility of the mountains and the unpredictable risks posed by climate change. For instance, during the 2009 construction of the second dam that got hit by flood water on Sunday, workers accidentally punctured an aquifer. Enough water for 2 million to 3 million people to drink drained out at the rate of up to 70 million liters (18.5 million gallons) every day for a month and villages in the area faced water shortages. Development plans need to “go along with the environment” and not against it, said Anjal Prakash, a professor at the Indian School of Business who has contributed to research into the impacts of climate change in the Himalayas for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “Climate change is here and now. It is not something that is going to happen later on,” he said.",Himalayan glacier disaster highlights climate change risks

The court ruled that the state has displayed “non-respect of its engagements” to combat global warming. “This is an historic win for climate justice,” said Jean- François Julliard, the executive director of Greenpeace France. “The decision not only takes into consideration what scientists say and what people want from French public policies, but it should also inspire people all over the world to hold their governments accountable for climate change in their courts.” Julliard believed the court ruling would push the government to finally take action, the Guardian reported. The Paris Agreement, signed five years ago, aimed to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. As punishment, the courts ordered the French state to pay the symbolic sum of 1 euro in compensation – a common practice in France – according to France 24. Former President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the deal, with then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo maintaining that the US was on track to achieve the goals even without membership. “Our results speak for themselves,” Pompeo wrote in a statement as the US began to withdraw from the agreement. “US emissions of criteria air pollutants that impact human health and the environment declined by 74 percent between 1970 and 2018. US net greenhouse gas emissions dropped 13 percent from 2005-2017, even as our economy grew over 19 percent.” Experts say governments have not done enough to keep up their commitments to the agreement and many have seen courts as a means of pushing governments to act. President Joe Biden committed to rejoining the Paris Agreement, signing an executive order on the day of his inauguration to that end. Biden then promptly canceled the Keystone XL Pipeline, sacrificing over 11,000 jobs in the process.",Paris courts find French government guilty of not upholding Paris Agreement

349,https://nypost.com/2021/02/05/under-the-sea-humans-have-changed-ocean-sounds/,NYP,Towards Right,"WASHINGTON — Not only are humans changing the surface and temperature of the planet, but also its sounds – and those shifts are detectable even in the open ocean, according to research published Thursday. Changes in the ocean soundscape affect wide swaths of marine life, from tiny snapping shrimp to huge right whales, the researchers found. “Sounds travel very far underwater. For fish, sound is probably a better way to sense their environment than light,” said Francis Juanes, an ecologist at the University of Victoria in Canada and a co-author of the paper in the journal Science. While light tends to scatter in water, he said, sounds travel much faster through water than through air. Many fish and marine animals use sound to communicate with each other, to locate promising locations to breed or feed and possibly to detect predators. For example, snapping shrimp make a sound resembling popping corn that stuns their prey. Humpback whale songs can resemble a violinist’s melodies. But increased noise from shipping traffic, motorized fishing vessels, underwater oil and gas exploration, offshore construction and other human activity is making it harder for fish to hear each other. The researchers sifted through thousands of data sets and research articles documenting changes in noise volume and frequency to assemble a comprehensive picture of how the ocean soundscape is changing – and how marine life is impacted. Using underwater microphones, scientists can record fish sounds – which tend to hover around the same low frequencies as shipping traffic noise. “For many marine species, their attempts to communicate are being masked by sounds that humans have introduced,” said Carlos Duarte, a marine ecologist at the Red Sea Research Center in Saudi Arabia and co-author of the paper. The Red Sea is one of the world’s key shipping corridors, full of large vessels traveling to Asia, Europe and Africa. Some fish and invertebrates now avoid the noisiest areas, as the sound effectively fragments their Red Sea habitat, he said. Meanwhile the overall number of marine animals has declined by about half since 1970. In some parts of the ocean, scientists now record “fewer animals singing and calling than in the past – those voices are gone,” said Duarte. Climate change also influences physical processes that shape ocean sounds, such as winds, waves and melting ice, the researchers found. “Imagine having to raise your kids in a place that’s noisy all the time. It’s no wonder many marine animals are showing elevated and detectable levels of stress due to noise,” said Joe Roman, a University of Vermont marine ecologist, who was not involved in the paper. “When people think of threats facing the ocean, we often think of climate change, plastics and overfishing. But noise pollution is another essential thing we need to be monitoring,” said Neil Hammerschlag, a University of Miami marine ecologist, who was not involved with the paper. “If you make something for the ocean, think about how to make it quieter,” he said. Sound pollution may be simpler to address than other ocean threats, said the University of Victoria’s Juanes. “In theory, you can reduce or turn off sound immediately — it’s not like plastics or climate change, which are much harder to undo.”","Under the sea, humans have changed ocean sounds"

Peter Altmaier said figures show Germany’s emissions of planet-heating gases were 42 percent lower in 2020 than three decades ago, confounding warnings that the country couldn’t meet its goal. While the coronavirus pandemic helped reduce emissions, Altmaier said the target would likely have been achieved anyway even without the drop in economic activity because of the lockdown. Separately, the German government agreed Wednesday to increase the share of renewable fuels in the transport sector to 28 percent over the next decade — double the target set by the European Union as a whole. Greenhouse gas emissions in Germany’s transport sector have hardly declined since 1990 as more and cars hit the road, outweighing the effect of more efficient engines. The government’s plan, which needs to be approved by parliament, includes incentives for the use of electric cars, hydrogen and biofuels made from renewable sources.

For a short time, temperatures in some places in the eastern United States, Russia and China were as much as half to two-thirds of a degree (.3 to .37 degrees Celsius) warmer. That’s due to less soot and sulfate particles from car exhaust and burning coal, which normally cool the atmosphere temporarily by reflecting the sun’s heat, Tuesday’s study in the journal Geophysical Research Letters reported. Overall, the planet was about .05 degrees (.03 degrees Celsius) warmer for the year because the air had fewer cooling aerosols, which unlike carbon dioxide is pollution you can see, the study found. “Cleaning up the air can actually warm the planet because that (soot and sulfate) pollution results in cooling” which climate scientists have long known, said study lead author Andrew Gettelman, an atmospheric scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. His calculations come from comparing 2020 weather to computer models that simulated a 2020 without the pollution reductions from pandemic lockdowns. This temporary warming effect from fewer particles was stronger in 2020 than the effect of reduced heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions, Gettelman said. That’s because carbon stays in the atmosphere for more than a century with long-term effects, while aerosols remain in the air about a week. Even without the reduction in cooling aerosols, global temperatures in 2020 already were flirting with breaking yearly heat record because of the burning of coal, oil and natural gas — and the aerosol effect may have been enough to help make this the hottest year in NASA’s measuring system, said top NASA climate scientist Gavin Schmidt, who wasn’t part of this study but said it confirms other research. “Clean air warms the planet a tiny bit, but it kills a lot fewer people with air pollution,” Gettelman said.",Study finds pandemic’s cleaner air added heat to warming planet

Television broadcast images of air tankers flying over the flames spread across more than 17,300 acres, about 25 miles from the state capital of Perth. No deaths had been reported so far. “Right now, Western Australia is battling two different kinds of emergencies – a dangerous fire emergency and a COVID-19 lockdown emergency,” said its premier, Mark McGowan. Perth has been locked down for five days after a coronavirus infection was detected on Sunday. But Tuesday was the state’s second straight day with no new infections, allaying fears of a fresh outbreak. The state issued an emergency fire warning for some suburbs and semi-rural areas near Perth, urging residents to take immediate action to ensure survival. “There is a threat to lives and homes,” the fire department said on its website as authorities advised people they could leave their homes for the closest evacuation centre despite the virus lockdown. More than 200 firefighters were battling the flames, while officials warned climate conditions were unlikely to bring quick relief.

353,https://nypost.com/2021/02/02/crews-work-to-repair-washed-out-scenic-highway-near-big-sur/,NYP,Towards Right,"SAN FRANCISCO — Crews worked Monday to determine when they can rebuild a section of scenic roadway near Big Sur after it collapsed in torrential rain last week, but the damage was not as bad as from a 2017 landslide that cut off the tourist destination along the central California coast for over a year, officials said. The intense rainstorms created a debris flow that overwhelmed water drains, flowed across Highway 1 and eroded it, washing away a 150-foot (46-meter) chunk of roadway, the state Department of Transportation said. The section that crumbled in Monterey County is about 30 miles south of a famous bridge that’s frequently photographed by tourists and was featured in the opening credits of HBO’s “Big Little Lies.” The winding highway is a popular driving route renowned for its ocean views. The road also shut down for weeks last year because of a wildfire that started in Big Sur in August and was finally contained on Dec. 31. Following the storm last week, crews were still working to clear debris piles, remove slides, clear and repair drainage systems and stabilize damaged sections of Highway 1 at about 60 places, Caltrans said. The agency initially closed 44 miles of the road to allow people to evacuate but said the closures would be reduced to about 23 miles Monday evening. Drone video of the highway shows a huge chasm and both northbound and southbound lanes missing. There was no estimate on when the road would reopen, Caltrans said. But the rain damage is not as extensive as when heavy rains in 2017 unleashed a landslide on the highway and caused a bridge to crumble, blocking passage through the area for over a year, said Big Sur Chamber of Commerce President Kirk Gafill, owner of the historic Nepenthe Restaurant that’s been serving Big Sur since 1949. “In 2017, it was a much bigger slide, it was the biggest slide in county history. This is a pretty typical slip out here,” Gafill said. He said the washout will impact some businesses and residents and force those traveling from Southern California to take a detour that will add about two hours to their trip. But he said the bulk of Big Sur’s businesses and residents won’t be largely affected because about 60 percent of visitors travel to the coastal communities known for luxury spas, posh hotels and scenic retreats from Northern California. “For the bulk of the visitors, they won’t even know the road is closed because they don’t travel that far south because they’re driving down and then turning around,” Gafill said.",Crews work to repair washed-out scenic highway near Big Sur
354,https://nypost.com/2021/01/30/bidens-climate-executive-orders-devastated-these-us-workers/,NYP,Towards Right,"On the morning of Jan. 20, every room of the two-story Stroppel Hotel in Midland, SD, was filled with men and women who work on the Keystone XL pipeline. Most of these union laborers, welders and pipefitters started their day over a cup of coffee in the hotel’s common room before heading out to their jobs.  By 4 p.m., the entire place was cleared out, leaving the historic hotel silent for the first time since owners Laurie and Wally Cox took it over six months ago. “Our whole world turned upside down with the stroke of a pen,” Laurie said.  She is speaking of President Biden’s executive order, signed on his first day in office, that halted work on the Keystone XL pipeline in South Dakota and immediately eliminated 1,000 union jobs. TC Energy, the company that was developing the project, predicts that more than 10,000 jobs will be lost in 2021 due to the order.  Now Laurie, who holds a master’s degree in social work, sits alone in the vacant hotel while her husband Wally finds work as a millwright hours away. She starts to cry as she recalls how they bought the building in late September and quickly turned it into an affordable and social place for pipeline workers to stay.  “We structured our prices to suit the per diems of each trade,” she said. “We created a common room because there is a real sense of community within these workers, and we thrived since the day we opened our doors.”  Since Jan. 20, “the entire town became an instant ghost down.”  The XL pipeline wasn’t the only project stopped by Biden’s pen. On Wednesday, he issued an executive order halting oil and gas leasing and drilling permits on federal lands and waters.  That order hit hardest in New Mexico, where the oil- and gas-rich Permian Basin lies largely on federal land.  “As a direct result of the executive order, I was just contacted by a Canadian company to inform me that the plant they were going to construct and operate in south Eddy County will instead go to Reeves County in Texas where their operation will not be surrounded by federal land,” said John Waters, executive director of the Carlsbad Department of Development.  In New Mexico alone, potentially 62,000 jobs and $1 billion in revenue will be lost in the first year after Biden signed his mandate, according to a recent economic impact study by the American Petroleum Institute.  “It will also cost a lot of jobs in the industry, the small businesses that support them and take a major bite out of our economic development,” Waters said.  New Mexico’s oil, gas and mining industries fund 40 percent of the state’s tax revenue. In 2019, that totaled $3.1 billion, with $1.36 billion of that flowing to public schools. As a result of the order, education and community services will suffer, while taxes will inevitably increase in a state that consistently ranks as one of the poorest in the country. “Many people who work in the industry are Hispanic,” added Waters, a Carlsbad native. “This hurts across the board. It’s literally kicking a state that’s already down while they’re down.”  The offshore drilling ban will also hurt the Gulf Coast of Louisiana. Data compiled by API shows it could potentially result in a loss of 48,000 jobs by 2022 and put more than $95 million in state revenue at risk.  Jaedon Burregi’s grocery store in Galliano, La., is one business that depends on the industry.  “We cater a lot to the oil and gas industry by delivering to all the supply boats that then deliver to the rigs,” said Burregi, 29, whose family owns and runs the Galliano Food Store. “There are four of us in the family who work here and we employ 55 people. We will immediately feel the economic impact.”  Burregi said if Biden came to his hometown he’d show him around his store and introduce him to his employees, so the president could see how his policies have actually impacted their lives.  “It’s easy when you live in bigger cities on the East Coast or West Coast to enact policies that pick winners and losers,” Burregi said. “But small towns are the ones most often affected.”  When Gina McCarthy, Biden’s national climate change adviser, was asked why the administration is punishing the oil and gas industries in the middle of an economic crisis, she said they’re doing it because the economy is stagnant and “environmental justice communities have been left behind.” Biden has also stressed that his policies will create jobs in the green energy sector.  But these answers miss the fact that Biden’s executive actions will devastate thousands of Americans, who come from a wide range of places, ethnicities and political viewpoints.  Elections, of course, have consequences.  And “those of us in the energy industry or support them are the carnage,” said Laurie Cox. “I fear this is just the tip of the iceberg of what comes next.”",Biden’s climate executive orders devastated these US workers in a day
355,https://nypost.com/2021/01/28/empty-seas-oceanic-shark-populations-dropped-71-since-1970/,NYP,Towards Right,"WASHINGTON — When marine biologist Stuart Sandin talks about sharks, it sounds like he’s describing Jedis of the ocean. “They are terrific predators, fast swimmers and they have amazing senses — they can detect any disturbance in the ocean from great distance,” such as smells or tiny changes in water currents. Their ability to quickly sense anything outside the norm in their environment helps them find prey in the vastness of the open ocean. But it also makes them especially vulnerable in the face of increased international fishing pressure, as global fishing fleets have doubled since 1950. “You drop a fishing line in the open ocean and often it’s sharks that are there first — whether or not they’re the primary target,” said Sandin, who works at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Scientists have known for decades that individual shark species are declining, but a new study drawing on 57 global datasets underscores just how dramatically worldwide populations have collapsed in the past half century. Globally, the abundance of oceanic sharks and rays dropped more than 70 percent between 1970 and 2018, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature. And 24 of the 31 species of sharks and rays are threatened with extinction, while three species — oceanic whitetip sharks, scalloped hammerhead sharks and great hammerhead sharks — are considered critically endangered. “The last 50 years have been pretty devastating for global shark populations,” said Nathan Pacoureau, a biologist at Simon Fraser University in Canada and a co-author of the study. Sometimes sharks are intentionally caught by fishing fleets, but more often they are reeled in incidentally as “ bycatch,” in the course of fishing for other species such as tuna and swordfish. Sharks and rays are both fish with skeletons made of cartilage, not bone. In contrast to most other kinds of fish, they generally take several years to reach sexual maturity and they produce fewer offspring. “In terms of timing, they reproduce more like mammals – and that makes them especially vulnerable,” said Pacoureau. “Their populations cannot replenish as quickly as many other kinds of fish.” The number of fishing vessels trolling the open ocean has risen steeply since the 1950s, as engine power expanded ships’ range. And while climate change and pollution also imperil shark survival, increased fishing pressure is the greatest threat for every oceanic shark species. “When you remove top predators of the ocean, it impacts every part of the marine food web,” said Stuart Pimm, an ecologist at Duke University, who was not involved in the study. “Sharks are like the lions, tigers and bears of the ocean world and they help keep the rest of the ecosystem in balance.”",Oceanic shark populations dropped 71 percent since 1970
356,https://nypost.com/2021/01/28/mcconnell-biden-energy-restrictions-will-harm-economic-recovery/,NYP,Towards Right,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday slammed President Biden for unleashing a “tsunami of pink slips” as part of a “craving for symbolic gestures” with his $2 trillion environmental policy agenda announced Wednesday. McConnell (R-Ky.) said those policies, including a moratorium on new oil and gas drilling on federal lands, will harm the economic recovery from COVID-19. “China, Russia and our other competitors must be thrilled, absolutely thrilled that our new government is essentially declaring war on some of our own economic foundations to satisfy a craving for symbolic gestures,” McConnell said on the Senate floor. McConnell said the push is “willfully throwing our own people out of work, reducing our domestic energy security, rising costs and prices for working families. All for no meaningful impact on global temperatures, just to buy applause at those international conferences where the participants all assemble by private jet.” Biden on Wednesday unveiled a lengthy set of actions and proposals to restrain coal, oil and gas and promote renewable energy sources — after withdrawing approval for the Keystone XL oil pipeline and rejoining the Paris Climate Accord last week. According to statistics cited by McConnell, “the decision on federal lands will leave us down nearly 1 million American jobs by next year alone.” “It is a heck of a way to kick off a presidency — mass layoffs of our own citizens, working Americans in other sectors will pay as well. One analysis found his decision could increase household energy costs by almost $20 billion over the next decade. And President Biden, [environmental adviser] John Kerry and the whole gang appear to be just getting warmed up,” McConnell said. He said federal lands account for 65 percent of oil and gas jobs in New Mexico and 40 percent in Colorado. McConnell is the most powerful Republican in Washington due to Senate rules that require a 60-vote super-majority to pass legislation. Some of Biden’s priorities outlined in his Wednesday order will require legislation, such as a plan to replace US Postal Service trucks with electric vehicles. McConnell accused Biden — who on Wednesday argued his policies would create new jobs — of misrepresenting himself as a friend to union workers. “It shouldn’t be this way, not with a president who campaigned on protecting the lunch-pail union jobs that his left flank wants to eliminate. The president was not elected to enact policies that prompt a certain young congresswoman from New York City to boast online that her radical ideas are shaping his energy policies,” he said, referring to celebratory remarks from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). McConnell said US carbon emissions were declining under former President Donald Trump’s policies, so abrupt policy changes weren’t needed. “The last four years prove that growing our prosperity, reducing emissions and expanding domestic energy are actually not in tension. We can achieve all three,” he said. “There’s nothing green about a tsunami of pink slips for American workers or carting Canadian crude around [in] trucks and trains instead of a pipeline.” Kerry, Biden’s climate czar, admitted Wednesday that the US reducing its emissions to zero wouldn’t make much of a difference in the global climate change fight — before pushing domestic manufacturing of electric cars and solar panels in favor of energy production. “He knows Paris alone is not enough,” Kerry told reporters at a White House press briefing, referring to Biden re-entering the US in the Paris Climate Agreement in one of his first acts as president. “Not when almost 90 percent of all of the planet’s global emissions come from outside of US borders. We could go to zero tomorrow and the problem isn’t solved,” Kerry conceded. Responding to a question about Biden’s climate plan causing massive job losses in oil, gas and coal industries in states across the country, Kerry insisted that energy workers had been “fed a false narrative” about what environmental policy changes would do to their livelihoods. The truth, he said, was that the people working in energy and coal impacted by climate change efforts will “have better choices” and can “go to work to make the solar panels.” “They’ve been fed the notion that somehow dealing with climate is coming at their expense,” Kerry said. “No, it’s not. What’s happening to them is happening because of other market forces already taking place.” “Coal plants have been closing over the last 20 years. So what President Biden wants to do is make sure those folks have better choices, that they have alternatives, and they can be the people who go to work to make the solar panels.”",McConnell: Biden unleashed ‘tsunami of pink slips’ with new energy restrictions

The company’s address in the registry matches that of the Heinz Family Foundation, according to the network. The plane’s registration certificate was issued in July 2005 and expires in October 2023, according to FAA records cited by Fox News. It unclear how much Kerry benefited from his wife’s company, but corporate jets have been estimated to emit upward of 40 times as much carbon per passenger as commercial aircraft, the outlet noted.

Biden pitched the package of policy changes — including eliminating coal, oil and natural gas as electricity sources by 2035 — as a boon to the workforce, but was met with worry over the current jobs that would be lost amid a health crisis, economic crisis and $27 trillion national debt. Patrick Morrisey, West Virginia’s Republican attorney general, said Wednesday that Biden’s policies will be “destructive” to the economy, especially as it tries to recover from the coronavirus business slowdown.  “What we’re seeing in the first week of the Biden administration is that the president is really taking a wrecking ball to many of the states that have oil, gas, coal, manufacturing jobs — that’s gonna have a real detrimental impact, especially as the American economy is coming out of COVID-19, a pandemic,” Morrisey said on Fox News. He said that “Biden is going much further” than former President Barack Obama with the green push. “I think he’s really kicking the American people when they’re down economically and it’s not a message of unity that he’s been talking about,” Morrisey said. Biden tried to overcome skepticism about the impact of his policy proposals on sectors that employ millions of people. “Today is climate day at the White House, which means that today is jobs day at the White House,” Biden said before signing an executive order “to meet the climate crisis for American jobs and American engineering.” Biden said “this executive order, it’s about jobs, good paying union jobs. It’s about workers building our economy back better than before. It’s a whole of government approach to put climate change at the center of our domestic, national security and foreign policy.” The text of the order says the government will “pause” new oil and gas leases on federal lands and orders changes to federal procurement to purchase “clean and zero-emission vehicles for Federal, State, local, and Tribal government fleets, including vehicles of the United States Postal Service.” The order proposes a goal of “conserving 30 percent of our lands and waters by 2030” and a new “Civilian Climate Corps.” It broadly requires federal agencies to develop plans to support renewable energy and environmental initiatives. Some elements of the plan will require legislation. Biden did not directly address the anticipated job losses from mandating a move toward renewable energy sources for cars and electricity, but tried to reframe the issue as an economic opportunity. “This is a case where conscience and convenience cross paths, where dealing with this existential threat to the planet and increasing our economic growth and prosperity are one and the same. When I think of climate change and the answers to it, I think of jobs,” Biden said. He said, “we can put millions of Americans to work modernizing our water systems, transportation, our energy infrastructure to withstand the impacts of extreme climate.” Specifically, he said, “We’re going to harness the purchasing power of the federal government to buy clean zero-emission vehicles that are made and sourced by union workers right here in America.” Biden said his policies, including using federal purchasing power to buy electric cars, will mean “1 million new jobs in the American automobile industry.” He added, “We’ll take steps toward achieving my goal of 100 percent carbon pollution-free electric sector by 2035.” Biden said, “We are going to create more than a quarter-million jobs to do things like plug in millions of abandoned oil and gas wells that pose an ongoing threat to the health and safety of our communities.” But Biden faces skepticism about new regulations offsetting job losses, including from centrist Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who could derail legislation in the evenly split Senate. Manchin also will be chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Dan Naatz of the Independent Petroleum Association of America said of the drilling moratorium: “Do not be fooled, this is a ban… The Biden administration’s plan to obliterate the jobs of American oil and gas explorers and producers has been on clear display.” John Kerry, Biden’s top environmental policy adviser, took criticism for telling reporters at a Wednesday briefing that “what President Biden wants to do is make sure those folks have better choices. That they have alternatives. They can be the people to go to work to make the solar panels.” Benjamin Weingarten, a fellow at the conservative Claremont Institute, retorted: “Is John Kerry completely ignorant of economics, or just this cynical and callous?” Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), the fourth-ranking House Republican, signaled that Biden will see resistance from conservatives on Capitol Hill, where Democrats have thin margins in each chamber. “Pie-in-the-sky government mandates and directives that restrict our mining, oil, and gas industries adversely impact our energy security and independence,” she said. “At a time when millions are struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the last thing Americans need is big government destroying jobs, while costing the economy billions of dollars.”",Biden pitches Green New Deal-like $2 trillion environmental plan
359,https://nypost.com/2021/01/26/rubbish-covered-lake-brings-to-light-balkans-waste-problem/,NYP,Towards Right,"PRIBOJ, Serbia — Trucks and building machines are parked on a river dam in southwest Serbia but not for construction work. Instead, huge cranes are being used to clear tons of garbage crammed at the foot of the power plant. Serbia and other Balkan nations are overwhelmed by communal waste after decades of neglect and lack of efficient waste-management policies in the countries aspiring to join the European Union. Burning rubbish dumps can be seen from the roads, plastic bags are hanging from trees and islands of waste are floating down the region’s rivers. The problem usually comes into focus in winter, when swollen waters sweep over landfills, pushing the garbage toward hydropower dams. This has been the case at the Potpec accumulation lake near the power plant after a spate of rainy and snowy weather in December and early January. The surface of the lake got covered in a thick layer of waste ranging from plastics to rusty metal scraps, tree trunks and even reportedly a coffin. The garbage has been swept downstream by the Lim River, which feeds the Potpec dam. The Lim originates in neighboring Montenegro, passing through several municipalities and their waste sites in both Montenegro and Serbia. “Based on a recent study, we found out that in these towns, in the five municipalities in Montenegro and three in Serbia, about 45,000 tons of waste are collected (per year),” said Predrag Saponjic, the Lim River hydropower plant system manager. Looking at the rubbish-strewn lake, he added that “even if only a fraction of that waste ends up in the Lim River, we get this.” Environmentalists in the Balkans have warned that because most landfills aren’t managed properly they leak toxic materials into rivers, threatening ecosystems and wildlife. Bosnia too has reported a garbage pileup that endangers the hydroelectric dam on the Drina River, near the eastern town of Visegrad. The Lim is one of the tributaries of the Drina, which makes their waterways — and garbage flows — closely connected. The two emerald-colored rivers — the Drina flows along the border between Serbia and Bosnia — during summer are favored by adventurers and water rafters who enjoy the winding waterways and seemingly pristine nature. While Balkan nations have been struggling to recover following a series of wars and crises in the 1990s, environmental issues often come last for the countries whose economies are lagging far behind the rest of Europe and where public funds are vulnerable to widespread corruption. Jugoslav Jovanovic, from Serbia’s state-run Srbijavode company that is in charge of the country’s water system, put the waste problem down to “our neglect and lack of care.” Landfills are located too close to rivers and are overfilled rather than closed down over the years, he warned. “If we find ourselves forced to do this year after year, then that’s not really a solution,” he said of the clearing operation. “We must find common ground and solve this by joining forces.” Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia have held meetings on the issue but little has been done. The Balkan countries also face other environmental emergencies, including dangerous levels of air pollution in many cities. Experts predict the clearing of Potpec lake will take few weeks, depending on the weather. However, all the garbage from the water will end up again on a landfill in western Serbia. Goran Rekovic, an activist from the nearby town of Priboj, said raising public awareness about pollution is a key goal, along with “institutional and systematic” solutions. These are needed also if Serbia and other Balkan countries wish to move closer to EU membership. “This is not European Union’s obligation. We should not be doing this for them,” Rekovic said. “The reason why we should take care of our environment is for our own future generations.”",Rubbish-covered lake brings to light Balkans waste problem

The project, called “Reset Earth,” was produced by the U.N. Environment Program’s Ozone Secretariat. The ozone layer is a thin part of the atmosphere which protects the Earth from harmful levels of ultraviolet radiation. The secretariat said the film and game explore the story of how in the 1980s the global scientific community came together to start reversing damage caused to the ozone layer and adopt treaties to restrict or ban use of ozone-depleting substances used for refrigeration, in air conditioners and aerosol sprays including chlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons.

361,https://nypost.com/2021/01/25/earth-is-losing-ice-faster-today-than-in-the-mid-1990s-study-suggests/,NYP,Towards Right,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska – Earth’s ice is melting faster today than in the mid-1990s, new research suggests, as climate change nudges global temperatures ever higher. Altogether, an estimated 28 trillion metric tons of ice have melted away from the world’s sea ice, ice sheets and glaciers since the mid-1990s. Annually, the melt rate is now about 57 percent faster than it was three decades ago, scientists report in a study published Monday in the journal The Cryosphere. “It was a surprise to see such a large increase in just 30 years,” said co-author Thomas Slater, a glaciologist at Leeds University in Britain. While the situation is clear to those depending on mountain glaciers for drinking water, or relying on winter sea ice to protect coastal homes from storms, the world’s ice melt has begun to grab attention far from frozen regions, Slater noted. Aside from being captivated by the beauty of polar regions, “people do recognize that, although the ice is far away, the effects of the melting will be felt by them,” he said. The melting of land ice – on Antarctica, Greenland and mountain glaciers – added enough water to the ocean during the three-decade time period to raise the average global sea level by 3.5 centimeters. Ice loss from mountain glaciers accounted for 22 percent of the annual ice loss totals, which is noteworthy considering it accounts for only about 1 percent of all land ice atop land, Slater said. Across the Arctic, sea ice is also shrinking to new summertime lows. Last year saw the second-lowest sea ice extent in more than 40 years of satellite monitoring. As sea ice vanishes, it exposes dark water which absorbs solar radiation, rather than reflecting it back out of the atmosphere. This phenomenon, known as Arctic amplification, boosts regional temperatures even further. The global atmospheric temperature has risen by about 1.1 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. But in the Arctic, the warming rate has been more than twice the global average in the last 30 years. Using 1994–2017 satellite data, site measurements and some computer simulations, the team of British scientists calculated that the world was losing an average of 0.8 trillion metric tons of ice per year in the 1990s, but about 1.2 trillion metric tons annually in recent years. Calculating even an estimated ice loss total from the world’s glaciers, ice sheets and polar seas is “a really interesting approach and one that’s actually quite needed,” said geologist Gabriel Wolken with the Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys. Wolken was a co-author on the 2020 Arctic Report Card released in December but was not involved with the new study. In Alaska, people are “keenly aware” of glacial ice loss, Wolken said. “You can see the changes with the human eye.” Research scientist Julienne Stroeve of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado noted the study had not included snow cover over land, “which also has a strong albedo feedback”, referring to a measure of how reflective a surface is. The research also did not consider river or lake ice or permafrost, except to say that “these elements of the cryosphere have also experienced considerable change over recent decades.”",Earth is losing ice faster today than in the mid-1990s

363,https://nypost.com/2021/01/21/world-leaders-laud-us-return-to-climate-fight-under-biden/,NYP,Towards Right,"BERLIN — World leaders breathed an audible sigh of relief that the United States under President Joe Biden is rejoining the global effort to curb climate change, a cause that his predecessor had shunned. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were among those welcoming Biden’s decision to rejoin the the Paris climate accord, reversing a key Trump policy in the first hours of his presidency Wednesday. “Rejoining the Paris Agreement is hugely positive news,” Johnson wrote on Twitter. Britain, which is hosting this year’s UN climate summit, looked forward to working with the Biden administration on the issue, he said. Macron likewise tweeted his joy at the US rejoining the Paris pact, saying that with Biden, “we will be stronger to face the challenges of our time. Stronger to build our future. Stronger to protect our planet.” The accord, forged in the French capital in 2015, commits countries to put forward plans for reducing their emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, which is released from burning fossil fuels. Former President Donald Trump had questioned the scientific warnings about man-made global warming, at times accusing other countries of using the Paris accord as a club to hurt Washington. The US formally left the pact in November. By contrast, Biden put the fight against climate change at the center of his presidential campaign and on Wednesday immediately launched a series of climate-friendly efforts to bring Washington back in step with the rest of the world on the issue. “A cry for survival comes from the planet itself,” Biden said in his inaugural address. “A cry that can’t be any more desperate or any more clear now.” Experts say any international efforts to keep global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), ideally 1.5C (2.7F), as agreed in the Paris accord would struggle without the contribution of US, which is the world’s second-biggest carbon emitter. Scientists say time is running out to reach that goal because the world has already warmed 1.2 C (2.2 F) since pre-industrial times. Italy said the US return to the Paris accord would help other countries reach their own climate commitments. “Italy looks forward to working with the US to build a sustainable planet and ensure a better future for the next generations,” Premier Giuseppe Conte tweeted. The Vatican, too, was clearly pleased given the decision aligns with Pope Francis’ environmental agenda and belief in multilateral diplomacy. In a front-page editorial in Wednesday’s L’Osservatore Romano, Vatican deputy editorial director Alessandro Gisotti noted that Biden’s decision to rejoin Paris “converges with Pope Francis’ commitment in favor of the custody of our common home.” German Chancellor Angela Merkel was more muted in her reaction, noting merely that her government would “probably have a more similar opinion” with Biden on issues such as the Paris climate accord, migration and the World Health Organization. Merkel’s conservative Union bloc has close ties to the German auto industry that’s fought against tougher emissions rules for cars. Her potential successor, Armin Laschet, has defended the continued mining of coal in his home state even as Germany phases out the fossil fuel by 2038. Germany’s Environment Minister Svenja Schulze, of the center-left Social Democrats, voiced greater excitement at Biden’s move. “The US is rejoining the fight against the climate crisis with great verve and enthusiasm,” Schulze said, adding that she hoped the new US administration would use the upcoming global summit to “reinforce their pursuit of climate neutrality with a concrete intermediate target for 2030.” Youth activists who have been at the forefront of demanding leaders take the threat of global warming seriously said they now want to see concrete action from Washington. “Many countries signed the Paris Agreement and they are still part of the Paris Agreement, but they make very free interpretations of what that implies,” said Juan Aguilera, one of the organizers of the Fridays for Future movement in Spain. “In many cases, signing it has become a show, because at the end of the day the concrete measures that are being taken, at least in the short term, are not satisfactory.” Biden has appointed a large team to tackle climate change both on the domestic and international front. Former Secretary of State John Kerry, named as the president’s special climate envoy, on Thursday took part in a virtual event with Italian industry at which he touted the ‘green economy’ as an engine for jobs and said the US planned to make up for time lost over the past four years. Organizers of a meeting Monday on adapting to climate change said they hoped Kerry would take part too and Biden himself has talked about inviting world leaders to a summit on the issue within his first 100 days in office. Over the coming months the US allies and rivals will closely watch to see by how much the administration offers to cut its emissions in the coming decade. A firm number is expected to be announced before the UN climate summit taking place in Glasgow, Scotland, in November.",World leaders laud US return to climate fight under Biden
364,https://nypost.com/2021/01/20/monarch-butterfly-population-moves-closer-to-extinction/,NYP,Towards Right,"SAN FRANCISCO — The number of western monarch butterflies wintering along the California coast has plummeted precipitously to a record low, putting the orange-and-black insects closer to extinction, researchers announced Tuesday. An annual winter count by the Xerces Society recorded fewer than 2,000 butterflies, a massive decline from the tens of thousands tallied in recent years and the millions that clustered in trees from Northern California’s Marin County to San Diego County in the south in the 1980s. Western monarch butterflies head south from the Pacific Northwest to California each winter, returning to the same places and even the same trees, where they cluster to keep warm. The monarchs generally arrive in California at the beginning of November and spread across the country once warmer weather arrives in March. On the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, another monarch population travels from southern Canada and the northeastern United States across thousands of miles to spend the winter in central Mexico. Scientists estimate the monarch population in the eastern US has fallen about 80 percent since the mid-1990s, but the drop-off in the western US has been even steeper. The Xerces Society, a nonprofit environmental organization that focuses on the conservation of invertebrates, recorded about 29,000 butterflies in its annual survey last winter. That was not much different than the tally the winter before, when an all-time low of 27,000 monarchs were counted. But the count this year is dismal. At iconic monarch wintering sites in the city of Pacific Grove, volunteers didn’t see a single butterfly this winter. Other well-known locations, such as Pismo State Beach Monarch Butterfly Grove and Natural Bridges State Park, only hosted a few hundred butterflies, researchers said. “These sites normally host thousands of butterflies and their absence this year was heartbreaking for volunteers and visitors flocking to these locales hoping to catch a glimpse of the awe-inspiring clusters of monarch butterflies,” said Sarina Jepsen, director of endangered species at the Xerces Society. Scientists say the butterflies are at critically low levels in western states because of destruction to their milkweed habitat along their migratory route as housing expands into their territory and use of pesticides and herbicides increases. Researchers also have noted the effect of climate change. Along with farming, climate change is one of the main drivers of the monarch’s threatened extinction, disrupting an annual 3,000-mile (4,828-kilometer) migration synched to springtime and the blossoming of wildflowers. Massive wildfires throughout the US West last year may have influenced their breeding and migration, researchers said. A 2017 study by Washington State University researchers predicted that if the monarch population dropped below 30,000, the species would likely go extinct in the next few decades if nothing is done to save them. Monarch butterflies lack state and federal legal protection to keep their habitat from being destroyed or degraded. In December, federal officials declared the monarch butterfly “a candidate” for threatened or endangered status but said no action would be taken for several years because of the many other species awaiting that designation. The Xerces Society said it will keep pursuing protection for the monarch and work with a wide variety of partners “to implement science-based conservation actions urgently needed to help the iconic and beloved western monarch butterfly migration.” People can help the colorful insects by planting early-blooming flowers and milkweed to fuel migrating monarchs on their paths to other states, the Xerces Society said.",Monarch butterfly population moves closer to extinction
365,https://nypost.com/2021/01/19/joe-bidens-plan-to-kill-keystone-xl-pipeline-will-kill-jobs-insult-canada/,NYP,Towards Right,"Poor Justin Trudeau. The Canadian prime minister must have been relieved to be done with President Trump, only to learn that Joe Biden plans to tell Canada to pound sand on his first day in office.  According to reports, Biden wants to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline immediately, a pointless and economically destructive gesture meant to appease his party’s climate fanatics.  The multibillion-dollar project to run from Alberta to Nebraska was first proposed years ago in the naive faith that two adjoining, friendly countries could cooperate on a big, mutually beneficial infrastructure project.  That was before Keystone XL became a hate totem for the left, which makes it sound like the pipeline might be the tipping point toward inevitable planetary destruction, among its myriad other alleged sins. President Barack Obama denied a cross-border permit for the project in 2015. Trump quickly reversed course. And now Biden is likely going to reverse Trump’s reversal.  It’s a symptom of our time that a major investment that deserves some stability in American decision-making has become a shuttlecock between outgoing and incoming administrations — and been caught in a nightmarish trap of litigation and red tape all the while.  It isn’t clear why adding new pipeline to an existing network built in previous phases of the Keystone project would be thought such a heinous environmental crime (Keystone XL is the fourth phase). Nor why this particular leg of pipeline is considered so threatening in a country that already has a couple millions miles of pipeline. The charge is that Keystone XL, by making it easier for Canada to export its “dirty” oil from the oil sands of Alberta, will herald the beginning of a fossil-fuel apocalypse. But we already consume lots of petroleum from the oil sands. According to the Canadian government, 97 percent of its proven reserves are located in the oil sands, and the oil sands account for more than 60 percent of the country’s current oil production.  Canada is the third-largest exporter of crude oil in the world, and 98 percent of that goes to the United States, accounting for almost half our imports of crude.  In a more rational time, it was considered a good thing to get oil from a country that isn’t located in Middle East, isn’t a petro-dictatorship and isn’t remotely hostile to the United States.  Canada also is a responsible, environmentally conscious country, unlike, say, Venezuela. It is true that extracting crude from the oil sands is somewhat more energy intensive than other forms of extraction, but it is foolish to pretend that this extra increment of carbon dioxide is the difference-maker in the future of the planet.  Regardless, this energy isn’t simply going to stay in the ground. It will be extracted and sent somewhere by some means. Today, much of it is being exported to the United States via rail. This is a more energy-intensive mode of transport than pipeline, yet the same people worried about marginal additional emissions aren’t agitating to get it out of railcars and into pipelines. The enemies of Keystone XL have used litigation to tie up the project, even though it has passed multiple massive regulatory reviews. When it seemed it could finally get underway in earnest, here comes Biden to put the kibosh on it again.  This is another sign that Biden’s version of moderation is giving the left what it wants, only in piecemeal fashion. He will surely be more polite to Canadian leaders than Trump was, but this is a blow to a Canadian government that thought it could rely on us to act rationally and shows that union workers take a backseat in the Democratic Party to noisy adherents of fashionable causes. If Biden really wants to restore our alliances, telling our friendly neighbor to the north to “drop dead” is a funny way to do it.  Twitter: @RichLowry","Biden’s plan to kill Keystone XL pipeline to appease loony left will kill jobs, insult top US ally"

The move could sound a death knell for the controversial project, which President Trump tried to resurrect early in his term after his predecessor, Barack Obama, opposed it. The phrase “Rescind Keystone XL pipeline permit” appeared on a list of Day One executive actions that Biden’s transition team gave to American stakeholders, according to Canada’s CBC News, which first reported the development on Sunday. The pledge did not appear on a memo that Biden chief of staff Ron Klain released Saturday outlining the administration’s early priorities, but it was included in a presentation that circulated among lobbyists and trade groups in Washington, Politico reported. Biden’s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday morning. By canceling the permit, Biden would reverse one of Trump’s first presidential actions and return to the Obama administration’s stance against the pipeline, which would move oil from the Canadian province of Alberta into Nebraska. Obama’s administration reportedly rejected the permit in 2015, saying the project would contradict its efforts to combat climate change. Trump signed an executive order allowing it to proceed in January 2017, but the project got caught up in a court battle that led to the Supreme Court upholding a ruling against it last year. Amid the reports about Biden’s plans, TC Energy — the Canadian company behind Keystone XL — released a statement addressing climate concerns about the project. It pledged that the pipeline — which Keystone XL president Richard Prior called “the safest and most reliable method to transport oil to markets” — would achieve “net zero” emissions when it goes into service in 2023 and that it would be fully powered by renewable energy by 2030. Biden had reportedly pledged during his campaign that his administration would pull the Keystone XL permit. But Canada’s ambassador to the US, Kirsten Hillman, said she would continue to promote the project given that it suits both countries’ environmental policies. “There is no better partner for the US on climate action than Canada as we work together for green transition,” Hillman said in a statement. Environmentalists, on the other hand, welcomed reports that a project they had battled for years could soon be gone for good. “President-elect Biden is showing courage and empathy to the farmers, ranchers and tribal nations who have dealt with an ongoing threat that disrupted their lives for over a decade,” Jane Kleeb of Bold Nebraska, a group focused on killing the pipeline, told Politico.

367,https://nypost.com/2021/01/15/2020-sets-yet-another-global-temperature-record/,NYP,Towards Right,"Earth’s rising fever hit or neared record hot temperature levels in 2020, global weather groups reported Thursday. While NASA and a couple of other measurement groups said 2020 passed or essentially tied 2016 as the hottest year on record, more agencies, including the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, said last year came in a close second or third. The differences in rankings mostly turned on how scientists accounted for data gaps in the Arctic, which is warming faster than the rest of the globe. “It’s like the film ‘Groundhog Day.’ Another year, same story — record global warmth,” said Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann, who wasn’t part of the measurement teams. “As we continue to generate carbon pollution, we expect the planet to warm up. And that’s precisely what we’re seeing.” Scientists said all you had to do was look outside: “We saw the heat waves. We saw the fires. We saw the (melting) Arctic,” said NASA top climate scientist Gavin Schmidt. “We’re expecting it to get hotter and that’s exactly what happened.” NOAA said 2020 averaged 58.77 degrees (14.88 degrees Celsius), a few hundredths of a degree behind 2016. NASA saw 2020 as warmer than 2016 but so close they are essentially tied. The European Copernicus group also called it an essential tie for hottest year, with 2016 warmer by an insignificant fraction. Japan’s weather agency put 2020 as warmer than 2016, but a separate calculation by Japanese scientists put 2020 as a close third behind 2016 and 2019. The World Meteorological Organization, the British weather agency and Berkeley Earth’s monitoring team had 2016 ahead. First or second rankings really don’t matter, “but the key thing to take away is that the long-term trends in temperature are very very clearly up and up and up,” said Schmidt, who heads NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies that tracks temperatures. “We’re in a position where we’re pushing the climate system out of the bounds that it’s been in for tens of thousands of years, if not millions of years.” All the monitoring agencies agree the six warmest years on record have been the six years since 2015. The 10 warmest have all occurred since 2005 and scientists say that warming’s driven by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. Temperatures the last six or seven years “really hint at an acceleration in the rise of global temperatures,” said Russ Vose, analysis branch chief at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information. While temperature increases have clearly accelerated since the 1980s, it’s too early to discern a second and more recent acceleration, Schmidt said. Last year’s exceptional heat “is yet another stark reminder of the relentless pace of climate change, which is destroying lives and livelihoods across our planet,” United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said in a statement. “Making peace with nature is the defining task of the 21st century.” The United States, which had its fifth warmest yea r, smashed the record for the number of weather disasters that cost at least $1 billion with 22 of them in 2020, including hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes and a Midwest derecho. The old record of 16 was set in 2011 and 2017. This was the sixth consecutive year with 10 or more billion-dollar climate disasters, with figures adjusted for inflation. Earth has now warmed 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times and is adding another 0.2 degrees Celsius (0.36 Fahrenheit) a decade. That means the planet is nearing an international warming threshold set in Paris in 2015, Vose and Schmidt said. Nations of the world set a goal of preventing at least 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming, with a tougher secondary goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). “We cannot avoid 1.5 C above pre-industrial now — it is just too late to turn things around,” University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado, who wasn’t on any of the measurement teams, said in an email. “I also fear that the 2 C threshold is slipping away from us too unless changes become much more immediate in the US and other nations.” Earth has warmed 1.6 degrees (0.9 degrees Celsius) since 1942, when President-elect Joe Biden was born and 1.2 degrees (0.6 degrees Celsius) since 1994, when pop star Justin Bieber was born, according to NOAA data. The main reason the agencies have varying numbers is because there are relatively few temperature gauges in the Arctic. NOAA and the British weather agency take a conservative approach in extrapolating for the missing data, while NASA factors that the Arctic is warming much faster than the rest of the globe, hitting 100 degrees (38 Celsius) in the Russian Arctic last June, said NASA’s Schmidt. The pandemic may have added ever so slightly to last year’s warming, enough to edge 2020 past 2016 in NASA’s calculations, Schmidt said. Around the globe, people were driving less — and that reduced short-term aerosol pollution which acts as a cooling agent by reflecting heat. Schmidt said fewer cooling aerosols could be responsible for .09 to .18 degrees (.05 to .1 degrees Celsius) warming for the year.

368,https://nypost.com/2021/01/12/scientists-decry-death-by-1000-cuts-for-worlds-insects/,NYP,Towards Right,"The world’s vital insect kingdom is undergoing “death by a thousand cuts,” the world’s top bug experts said. Climate change, insecticides, herbicides, light pollution, invasive species and changes in agriculture and land use are causing Earth to lose probably 1 percent to 2 percent of its insects each year, said University of Connecticut entomologist David Wagner, lead author in the special package of 12 studies in Monday’s Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences written by 56 scientists from around the globe. The problem, sometimes called the insect apocalypse, is like a jigsaw puzzle. And scientists say they still don’t have all the pieces, so they have trouble grasping its enormity and complexity and getting the world to notice and do something. Wagner said scientists need to figure out if the rate of the insect loss is bigger than with other species. “There is some reason to worry more,” he added, “because they are the target of attack” with insecticides, herbicides and light pollution. Co-author and University of Illinois entomologist May Berenbaum, a National Medal of Science winner, said, “Insect decline is kind of comparable to climate change 30 years ago because the methods to assess the extent, the rate (of loss) were difficult.” Making matters worse is that in many cases, people hate bugs, even though they pollinate the world’s foods, are crucial to the food chain and get rid of waste, she said. Insects “are absolutely the fabric by which Mother Nature and the tree of life are built,” Wagner said. Two well known ones — honeybees and Monarch butterflies — best illustrate insect problems and declines, he said. Honeybees have been in dramatic decline because of disease, parasites, insecticides, herbicides and lack of food. Climate change-driven drier weather in the US West means less milkweed for butterflies to eat, Wagner said. And changes in American agriculture remove weeds and flowers they need for nectar. “We’re creating a giant biological desert except for soybeans and corn in a giant area of the Midwest,” he said. Monday’s scientific papers don’t provide new data, yet show a big but incomplete picture of a problem starting to get attention. Scientists have identified 1 million insect species, while probably 4 million more are still to be discovered, Berenbaum said. University of Delaware entomologist Doug Tallamy, who wasn’t part of the studies, said they highlight how the world has “spent the last 30 years spending billions of dollars finding new ways to kill insects and mere pennies working to preserve them.” “The good news is, with the exception of climate change, individuals can do much to reverse insect declines,” Tallamy said in an email. “This is a global problem with a grassroots solution.”","Scientists decry death by 1,000 cuts for world’s insects"
369,https://nypost.com/2021/01/12/volkswagen-triples-electric-car-sales-ahead-of-climate-rules/,NYP,Towards Right,"FRANKFURT, Germany — Europe’s push into electric cars is gathering speed — despite the pandemic. Automaker Volkswagen tripled sales of battery-only cars in 2020 as its new electric compact ID.3 came on the market ahead of tough new European Union limits on auto emissions. And Germany, long a laggard in adopting electric vehicles, saw more people buy electrics in December than opted for previously dominant diesel vehicles. Those are early signs of what will likely be an upcoming year of increasing market share for electric cars as EU regulations drive their adoption, despite the recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic that has caused the overall car market to shrink. Volkswagen said Tuesday its namesake brand sold 134,000 battery-powered cars last year, up from 45,000 in 2019. Including hybrids, which combine an internal combustion engine and an electric motor, sales of electrified cars reached 212,000, up from 82,000 in 2019. Volkswagen’s announcement comes as the auto industry association in Germany reports that one in four cars sold in the country in December had an electric motor, uptake that was supported by incentives as part of the government stimulus package during the COVID-19 recession. Battery and hybrid cars took 26.6 percent of sales that month, running ahead of diesel cars, which had 26.2 percent. That is also a token of diesel’s steep decline after Volkswagen’s 2015 scandal involving diesel cars rigged to cheat on emissions tests. Electric cars have so far been a small but rapidly growing slice of the European market. According to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, in the July-September quarter of 2020 9.9 percent of cars sold were chargeable vehicles, up from 3.0 percent a year earlier. The association publishes full-year statistics on Feb. 4. Automakers in the EU must sell more zero-emission cars in order to meet tougher fleet average limits on emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas blamed for climate change. Those limits came fully into effect on Jan. 1. Failure to achieve a fleet average of less than 95 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer driven can mean heavy fines. Sales have been driven by government incentives and by an increasing number of new models that — like the ID.3 — were designed purely as electric cars, rather than being converted from internal combustion models. Electric-only design can mean more interior space as a selling point. The compact ID.3 isn’t coming to the US market, where Volkswagen will offer the electric ID.4 sport-utility vehicle made on the same mechanical base. Demand has been held back by lack of places to charge electric cars, including for people who live in apartment buildings and can’t install a charging box at home. Germany’s auto association, the VDA, said there’s only one publicly available charging station for every 17 electric cars. California-based Tesla has been a major factor in the electric upswing with its Model 3 and its proprietary network of fast-charging stations. The government in China, the world’s largest auto market, is also pressing carmakers to lower emissions. The uptake of electric vehicles has been slower in the United States, where regulatory pressure has been weaker and where gasoline costs as little as $2 per gallon, depending on the region. That compares to 1.30 euros per liter of gas, or $6 per gallon in Germany, much of which is taxes.",Volkswagen triples electric car sales ahead of climate rules
370,https://nypost.com/2021/01/12/study-wildfires-produced-up-to-half-of-pollution-in-us-west/,NYP,Towards Right,"BILLINGS, Mont. — Wildfire smoke accounted for up to half of all health-damaging small particle air pollution in the western US in recent years as warming temperatures fueled more destructive blazes, according to a study released Monday. Even as pollution emissions declined from other sources including vehicle exhaust and power plants, the amount from fires increased sharply, said researchers at Stanford University and the University of California, San Diego. The findings underscore the growing public health threat posed by climate change as it contributes to catastrophic wildfires such as those that charred huge areas of California and the Pacific Northwest in 2020. Nationwide, wildfires were the source of up to 25 percent of small particle pollution in some years, the researchers said. “From a climate perspective, wildfires should be the first things on our minds for many of us in the US,” said Marshall Burke, an associate professor of earth system science at Stanford and lead author of the study. “Most people do not see sea-level rise. Most people do not ever see hurricanes. Many, many people will see wildfire smoke from climate change,” Burke added. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The researchers used satellite images of smoke plumes and government air quality data to model how much pollution was generated nationwide by fires from 2016 to 2018 compared to a decade earlier. Their results were in line with previous studies of smoke emissions across earlier time periods and more limited geographic areas. Large wildfires churn out plumes of smoke thick with microscopic pollution particles that can drift hundreds or even thousands of miles. Driving the explosion in fires in recent years were warmer temperatures, drought and decades of aggressive fire fighting tactics that allowed forest fuels to accumulate. Air pollution experts say that residents of the West Coast and Northern Rockies in particular should expect major smoke events from wildfires to become more frequent. There’s little doubt air quality regulations helped decrease other sources of pollution even as wildfire smoke increased, said Loretta Mickley, an atmospheric chemist at Harvard University. But it’s difficult to separate how much of the increase in smoke pollution is driven by climate change versus the forest fuel buildup, she added. Mickley and researchers from Colorado State University also cautioned that fires can vary significantly from year to year because of weather changes, making it hard to identify trends over relatively short periods such as the decade examined in the new study. An AP analysis of data from government monitoring stations found that at least 38 million people in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana were exposed to unhealthy levels of wildfire smoke for at least five days in 2020. Major cities in Oregon suffered the highest pollution levels they had ever recorded. Smoke particles from those wildfires were blamed for health problems ranging from difficulty breathing to a projected spike in premature deaths, according to health authorities and researchers. Fires across the West emitted more than a million tons of particulate pollution in 2012, 2015 and 2017 and almost as much in 2018. Scientists studying long-term health problems have found correlations between smoke exposure and decreased lung function, weakened immune systems and higher rates of flu. The new study matches up with previous research documenting the increasing proportion of pollution that comes from wildfire smoke, said Dan Jaffe, a wildfire pollution expert at the University of Washington. Jaffe added that it also raises significant questions about how to better manage forests and the role that prescribed burns might play. “We have been making tremendous progress on improving pollution in this country, but at the same time we have this other part of the puzzle that has not been under control,” Jaffe said. “We’re now at the point where we have to think about how to manage the planet a whole lot more carefully than we’ve done.”",Study finds wildfires produced up to half of pollution in US West
371,https://nypost.com/2021/01/11/wielding-machetes-and-calipers-sweat-soaked-scientists-count-carbon-in-amazon/,NYP,Towards Right,"ITAPUÃ DO OESTE, Brazil – The machete-wielding scientists ventured into the Amazon, hacking through dense jungle as the mid-morning temperature soared past 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 C). Soaked in sweat, the small group of men and women sawed and tore trees limb from limb. They drilled into the soil and sprayed paint across tree trunks. This is vandalism in the name of science. In the trees about 90 km (55 miles) from Rondônia state capital Porto Velho, the Brazilian researchers are seeking to learn how much carbon can be stored in different parts of the world’s largest rainforest, helping to remove emissions from the atmosphere that foment climate change. “It’s important because we are losing forests globally,” said Carlos Roberto Sanquetta, a forestry engineering professor at the Federal University of Paraná in Brazil. “We need to understand what is the role that forests play,” both in absorbing carbon when they are left intact and releasing it when they are destroyed. Sanquetta led the weeklong research expedition in November, overseeing a team including a botanist, agronomist, biologist and several other forestry engineers to take myriad samples of vegetation – living and dead – for analysis. It’s rigorous and elaborate work, often in humid and insect-infested conditions, involving chainsaws, spades, corkscrews and calipers. “These are not white-coat scientists just lecturing people,” Raoni Rajão, who specializes in environmental management at the Federal University of Minas Gerais and is not involved with Sanquetta’s team. “These are hardworking people that get their hands dirty.” The Brazilian team is just one contingent among hundreds of researchers seeking to measure carbon in the complex and environmentally crucial Amazon rainforest ecosystem, which sprawls across more than six million square kilometers in nine countries. Some research seeks only to quantify carbon in trees, but Sanquetta says his team’s approach is holistic, measuring carbon in underbrush, soil and decomposing plant matter as well. In addition, his team is looking beyond primary forest, examining reforested areas to shed new light on how much carbon they hold – information key to incentivizing restoration efforts. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases, which lock heat into the earth’s atmosphere. Trees soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it as carbon, one of the cheapest and easiest ways to absorb greenhouse gas. The process also works in reverse, however. When trees are chopped down or burned – often to make way for farms or cow pastures – the wood releases CO2 back into the atmosphere. “Every time there is deforestation, it’s a loss, an emission of greenhouse gas,” said Sanquetta, who is a member of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s top climate science authority. At current emission rates, global temperatures are expected to rise about 2.9 degrees Celsius by 2100, according to nonprofit consortium Climate Action Tracker, far surpassing the 1.5- to 2-degree limit needed to avert catastrophic changes to the planet. Climate change raises sea levels, intensifies natural disasters and can spur the mass migration of refugees. Deforestation in the Amazon has accelerated during the administration of Jair Bolsonaro, the right-wing president of Brazil. Since he took office in 2019, at least 825 million tonnes of CO2 have been released from Brazilian Amazon deforestation. That’s more than emitted by all US passenger cars in a year. In a statement, the office of Brazilian Vice President Hamilton Mourão, who leads the government’s Amazon policy, said the rise in deforestation predated the current administration and that the government has been working around the clock to thwart destructive mining and lumber trafficking. “We have not achieved the desired degree of success, but it could have been worse,” the statement said. Key to understanding and addressing the climate threat is bringing more precision to carbon measurements in receding forests. “Everyone wants this information,” said Alexis Bastos, project coordinator of the nonprofit Rioterra Study Center, a Brazilian organization that provides financial support and several scientists to Sanquetta’s team. Today there are scientists measuring forest carbon on nearly every continent. Aside from Sanquetta’s team, for instance, the Amazon Forest Inventory Network with its more than 200 partner scientists is trying to standardize carbon and other measurements, garnering huge amounts of data to “quantify” the forest. The challenge is “there’s differences in species across the Amazon. In Peru in the southwest versus Guyana in the northeast, there’s virtually no species overlap at all, so it’s completely different plants in exactly the same climate,” said Oliver Phillips, the network’s coordinator and a tropical ecologist at the United Kingdom’s University of Leeds. The network’s partners use precise parameters to capture the major carbon reservoirs, including in dead plant matter and soil. For instance, if a tree is on the border of a plot, it should be measured only if more than 50 percent of its roots are in the plot. No one team could hope to sample enough of the vast rainforest for an exact count of carbon harbored by the Amazon. It’s also a moving target: The Amazon rainforest, which varies from tangled jungle to more open, riverine spaces, is constantly shifting, as more trees are chopped down while restoration efforts are accelerating. Sanquetta’s team began its current line of research in 2016, relying on support from Rioterra, which itself received funding from Petróleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras), the Brazilian state-owned oil firm. At the time, Rioterra was replanting destroyed areas of rainforest and wanted to know how much carbon was being sequestered. Petrobras told Reuters in a statement that it had been working for years to honor its “social responsibility” commitments, which among other things meant supplying energy while “overcoming sustainability challenges.” Each weeklong expedition costs about 200,000 reais ($36,915.35). Sanquetta said his project has not received any money from Petrobras directly. When the Petrobras funding dried up, Rioterra found support from the Amazon Fund, backed by the governments of Brazil, Norway and Germany. Preliminary findings indicate that planting a mix of Amazon species is more effective in sequestering carbon than allowing the area to regrow naturally. But findings also suggest there is no substitute for leaving forests untouched: A hectare of virgin Rondônia forest holds an average 176 tonnes of carbon, according to Sanquetta’s analysis of Brazilian Science Ministry data. By comparison, a replanted hectare of forest after 10 years holds about 44 tonnes and soy farms hold an average of only 2 tonnes. Out in the jungle, Sanquetta’s team members swatted away swarming, stingless bees, while they dissected a 10-by-20-meter plot that’s been growing back naturally for almost 10 years, abandoned by a farmer. The team counted 19 trees with trunks measuring at least 15-centimeters in circumference, a threshold above which trees generally hold significantly more carbon. Edilson Consuello de Oliveira, a 64-year-old botanist from neighboring Acre state, wrapped a tape measure around one of them. “Bellucia!” he called out, identifying Bellucia grossularioides, a fruit-bearing tree that is one of the fastest to regrow. He rattled off the measurements, while another scientist scribbled them down. A biologist nailed number markers into tree trunks. Meanwhile, a few in the group were hewing into a tree with a chainsaw, having selected it for “autopsy.” The shorn trunk was cut into pieces, the leaves stripped and bagged and the stump dug up and weighed on a hanging scale strung from branches above. “It’s destructive, but we only do it for a few trees,” said Sanquetta. Another group drove a motorized, 3-foot (1 meter) metal corkscrew into the ground and pulled up dirt from four different depths. Others measured the width of decomposing plants with calipers and raked up ground debris. The samples were taken back to the lab, where the team dried and weighed them, before incinerating them in a dry combustion chamber that allows them to measure how much carbon is contained. The team measured 20 plots during a week’s work in November. The final goal is 100 plots by later this year. The work offers “a way to measure the health of the planet,” Rajão said, but also “how quickly the planet could be healed.”",Sweat-soaked scientists hack through the Amazon to count carbon
372,https://nypost.com/2021/01/08/one-third-of-americas-rivers-have-changed-color-since-1984/,NYP,Towards Right,"America’s rivers are changing color — and people are behind many of the shifts, a new study said. One-third of the tens of thousands of mile-long river segments in the United States have noticeably shifted color in satellite images since 1984. That includes 11,629 miles that became greener, or went toward the violet end of the color spectrum, according to a study in this week’s journal Geographical Research Letters. Some river segments became more red. Only about 5 percent of US river mileage is considered blue — a color often equated with pristine waters by the general public. About two-thirds of American rivers are yellow, which signals they have lots of soil in them. But 28 percent of the rivers are green, which often indicates they are choked with algae. And researchers found 2 percent of US rivers over the years shifted from dominantly yellow to distinctly green. “If things are becoming more green, that’s a problem,” said study lead author John Gardner, a University of Pittsburgh geology and environmental sciences professor. Although some green tint to rivers can be normal, Gardener said, it often means large algae blooms that cause oxygen loss and can produce toxins. The chief causes of color changes are farm fertilizer run-off, dams, efforts to fight soil erosion and man-made climate change, which increases water temperature and rain-related run-off, the study authors said. “We change our rivers a lot. A lot of that has to do with human activity,” said study co-author Tamlin Pavelsky, a professor of global hydrology at the University of North Carolina. For example, Pavelsky said, the green at times in the Ohio River indicates a bad algae problem from farm runoff while rivers that are getting less yellow demonstrate the success of regulations to prevent soil erosion. The study looked at more than 230,000 NASA satellite images over 35 years, focusing on rivers and reservoirs. The study found much of the shift to greener rivers happened in the North and West, while the yellowing occurred more in the East and around the Mississippi River. It also found some rivers change colors naturally with the seasons. Outside experts praised the study, saying while hard-to-understand measurements have shown problems with American rivers, this illustrates the situation simply. The study “is super cool and a bit mind-blowing (yet intuitive),” Martin Doyle, head of water programs at Duke University, wrote in an email. “It shows how most every aspect of our planet is being affected by humans, now including the basic color of our water. That’s pretty profound if you think about it.” “It’s also important because it opens up the idea and potential of using river color as early-stage indicator, or warning of environmental change,” wrote Doyle, who wasn’t part of the study.",One-third of America’s rivers have changed color since 1984

The geyser in the Norris Geyser basin shoots water more than 300 feet into the air during its major eruptions.

379,https://nypost.com/2021/01/05/study-warming-already-baked-in-will-blow-past-climate-goals/,NYP,Towards Right,"The amount of baked-in global warming, from carbon pollution already in the air, is enough to blow past international agreed upon goals to limit climate change, a new study finds. But it’s not game over because, while that amount of warming may be inevitable, it can be delayed for centuries if the world quickly stops emitting extra greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, the study’s authors say. For decades, scientists have talked about so-called “committed warming” or the increase in future temperature based on past carbon dioxide emissions that stay in the atmosphere for well over a century. It’s like the distance a speeding car travels after the brakes are applied. But Monday’s study in the journal Nature Climate Change calculates that a bit differently and now figures the carbon pollution already put in the air will push global temperatures to about 2.3 degrees Celsius (4.1 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times. Previous estimates, including those accepted by international science panels, were about a 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit less than that amount of committed warming. International climate agreements set goals of limiting warming to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit since pre-industrial times, with the more ambitious goal of limiting it to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit added in Paris in 2015. The world has already warmed about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. “You’ve got some … global warming inertia that’s going to cause the climate system to keep warming and that’s essentially what we’re calculating,” said study co-author Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University. “Think about the climate system like the Titanic. It’s hard to turn the ship when you see the icebergs.” Dessler and colleagues at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab and Nanjing University in China calculated committed warming to take into account that the world has warmed at different rates in different places and that places that haven’t warmed as fast are destined to catch up. Places such as the Southern Ocean, surrounding Antarctica are a bit cooler and that difference creates low-lying clouds that reflect more sun away from earth, keeping these places cooler. But this situation can’t keep going indefinitely because physics dictates that cooler locations will warm up more and when they do, the clouds will dwindle and more heating will occur, Dessler said. Previous studies were based on the cooler spots staying that way, but Dessler and colleagues say that’s not likely. Outside experts said the work is based on compelling reasoning, but want more research to show that it’s true. Breakthrough Institute climate scientist Zeke Hausfather said the new work fits better with climate models than observational data. Just because the world is bound to get more warming than international goals, that doesn’t mean all is lost in the fight against global warming, said Dessler, who cautioned against what he called “climate doomers.” If the world gets to net zero carbon emissions soon, 2 degrees of global warming could be delayed enough so that it won’t happen for centuries, giving society time to adapt or even come up with technological fixes, he said. “If we don’t, we’re going to blow through (climate goals) in a few decades,” Dessler said. “It’s really the rate of warming that makes climate change so terrible. If we got a few degrees over 100,000 years, that would not be that big a deal. We can deal with that. But a few degrees over 100 years is really bad.”",Study: Warming already baked in will blow past climate goals

If it’s the only choice, then to choose anything else would be wrong and condemnable, foolhardy and inexcusable. Perhaps that’s why a recently resurfaced clip of former Democratic nominee for president, former secretary of state, and now climate envoy for the Biden administration John Kerry has received some renewed attention. The video features Kerry in Iceland in 2019, where he had traveled on a private plane to accept an award for . . . his climate advocacy. An Icelandic reporter, recognizing the incongruity of it all, confronted Kerry: Reporter: I understand you came here with a private jet. Is that an environmental way to travel? Kerry: If you offset your carbon, it’s the only choice for somebody like me who is traveling the world to win this battle. Kerry went on to tout his climate-related accomplishments, including his negotiation of the Paris Agreement, insisting that international travel is a necessary evil of his work. He then rebuked his questioner, saying “I’m not gonna be put on the defensive.” Given Kerry’s status as a public figure beholden to the American people, I’d prefer to keep him there. If you believe, as Kerry says he does, that climate change represents a nearly imminent and existential threat, then of course international agreements need to be negotiated and world leaders will need to travel to make them. But if it’s an existential threat, wouldn’t you want to negotiate agreements that do something about it? Kerry never shuts up about the Paris Agreement, but it does next to nothing to curb emissions. Sure, it sets goals for doing so, but it’s a non-binding treaty that goes easier on countries ramping up emissions (China and India) while setting stricter standards for those already making significant cuts (the United States.) Were I the alarmist Kerry is, I would count Paris among my greatest failures, not successes. Moreover, at the time of Kerry’s little trip, he was not traveling to negotiate a deal or talk strategy. He was in Iceland to do what John Kerry does best: feel pride and importance in being John Kerry. And to feel really important, one simply must fly private. Those tawdry first-class seats on a regularly scheduled commercial flight just won’t do. Maybe you think this is a cheap shot at Kerry. But I’m not sure there’s anything more detestable than a fabulously wealthy and immensely powerful man insisting that a private plane is the “only choice” for traveling to an award ceremony for a non-accomplishment like the Paris Agreement, while telling working-class Americans he’s helped strip of their jobs on the Keystone Pipeline — another symbolic, ineffectual measure — that he’s trying to provide and help them make “better choices.” So for me, lambasting John Kerry is the only choice.",John Kerry’s Ego Demands a Private Jet

The New York Times offers this hectoring headline: “No, Wind Farms Aren’t the Main Cause of the Texas Blackouts,” over a piece by Dionne Searcey. Of course they aren’t the main cause — as Searcey notes, they make up only about 7 percent of the power mix this time of year. But renewables, mostly wind, make up a disproportionate share of the downed capacity, about 40 percent of it — 18 gigawatts of the 45 gigawatts taken offline — according to the left-leaning Texas Tribune, relying on figures from the state electricity-grid manager. It’s a complex issue, but when 7 percent of your expected power represents 40 percent of your lost power, that is a significant fact. Renewables have been subsidized pretty richly, and it is not unreasonable to ask: What if that money had instead been spent on preparing the rest of the electricity infrastructure for events such as this storm — unusual, but by no means unforeseeable — and what light does answering that question throw on future policy decisions?",Windmill Politics

A pandemic led to national quarantine; to self-induced recession; to riot, arson, and looting; to a contested election; and to a riot at the U.S. Capitol. In response, are we focusing solely on upping the daily vaccination rate? Getting the country back to work? Opening the schools as the virus attenuates? Ensuring safety in the streets? Or are we descending into a sort of madness? It might have been understandable that trillions of dollars had to be borrowed to keep a suffocating economy breathing. But it makes little sense to keep borrowing $2 trillion a year to prime an economy now set to roar back with herd-like immunity on the horizon. Trillions of dollars in stimulus are already priming the economy. Cabin-feverish Americans are poised to get out of their homes to travel, eat out, and socialize as never before. Meanwhile, the United States will have to start paying down nearly $30 trillion in debt. But we seem more fixated on raising rather than reducing that astronomical obligation. We are told that man-made, worldwide climate change — as in the now discarded term “global warming” — can best be addressed by massive dislocations in the U.S. economy. The Biden administration plans to shut down coal plants. It will halt even nearly completed new gas and oil pipelines. It will cut back on fracking to embrace the multi-trillion-dollar “Green New Deal.” Americans should pause and examine the utter disaster that unfolded recently in Texas and its environs. Parts of the American Southwest were covered in ice and snow for days. Nighttime temperatures crashed to near zero in some places. The state, under pressure, had been transitioning from its near-limitless and cheap reservoirs of natural gas and other fossil fuels to generating power through wind and solar. But what happens to millions of Texans when wind turbines freeze up while storm clouds extinguish solar power? We are witnessing the answer in oil- and gas-rich but energy-poor Texas that is all but shut down. Millions are shivering without electricity and affordable heating. Some may die or become ill by this self-induced disaster — one fueled by man-made ideological rigidity. We’ll deliver The Capital Note to your inbox each weekday. No charge. Texas’s use of natural gas in power generation has helped the United States curb carbon emissions. Ignoring it for unreliable wind and solar alternatives was bound to have catastrophic consequences whenever a politically incorrect nature did not follow the global-warming script. In 2019, a special counsel wrapped up a 22-month, $35 million investigation into then–President Donald Trump’s alleged “collusion” with Russia in the 2016 election. Robert Mueller and his team searched long and hard for a crime and came up empty. Then Trump was impeached in December 2019 and acquitted in the Senate in early 2020. His purported crime was warning the Ukrainians about the Biden family’s quid pro quo racketeering. After the revelations concerning Hunter Biden’s shenanigans not only in Ukraine but also in Kazakhstan and China, Trump’s admonitions now seem prescient rather than impeachable. Trump had been threatened with removal from office under the 25th Amendment. He was accused of violating the Logan Act and the Constitution’s emoluments clause. His executive orders were often declared unconstitutional if not seditious. All these oppositional measures predictably failed to receive either public or congressional support. Finally, an exasperated Left decided to flog the presidential corpse of now private citizen Trump. It did so without a Supreme Court chief justice to oversee an impeachment trial in the Senate. The targeted president was no longer president. There was no special prosecutor, little debate, and even less cross-examination. In the end, the second impeachment was sillier than the first. But, like the first, the show trial wasted precious time and resources in the middle of a pandemic. But the height of our collective madness is the current cancel culture. Its subtexts are “unearned white privilege” and “white supremacy.” In the name of those abominations, mobs tear down statues, destroy careers, censor speech, require veritable oaths, and conduct reeducation training. Stranger still, those alleging “white privilege” are usually themselves quite wealthy, liberal — and white. These elites count on their incestuous networking, silver-spoon upbringings and tony degrees to leverage status, influence, and money in a way undreamed-of by the white working class. Affluent and privileged minorities likewise join the chorus to call for everything from reparations to “reprogramming” Trump voters. The most elite in America are the most likely to damn the privilege of those who lack it. Perhaps this illogic squares the psychological circle of feeling guilty about things they never have any intention of giving up. If blaming those without advantages does not satisfy the unhappy liberal elite, then there is always warring against the mute dead: changing their eponymous names, destroying their statues, slandering their memories, and denying their achievements.

The Cotton-Romney Plan to Raise the Minimum Wage Without Killing Jobs The Cotton-Romney Deal: $10 Minimum Wage for Immigration Enforcement A Compromise on Nominations It has been a rough year for the oil industry, as evidenced by the recent wave of historically weak earnings reports. The pandemic obliterated demand for a whole range of petroleum products, from gasoline to jet fuel. Any year in which your benchmark product has a negative price, as oil did for one day last spring, is going to be bad. Conditions in the natural-gas market have not been much better. Recently, prices have crawled back into the more favorable ranges, aided by OPEC coordination to bring supply in line with still-weak demand. Natural-gas prices have rallied with late-arriving winter. Even with the recent rally in oil prices, the future of the industry is uncertain. Last week, I listened to an industry executive articulate why companies like his were turning to the federal government for assistance in the form of oil-import tariffs. The push to restrict energy imports is a moonshot bet that somehow “Buy American” can be contorted into a policy to help domestic producers. The proposal is premised on faulty economics and a narrow policy gestalt. The industry is stuck with a less optimistic outlook than it might have hoped for. Bullish forecasts for the coming months have been jarred by a slow vaccine rollout and initial moves by the Biden administration to deliver on climate campaign priorities. Optimists point to pent-up travel demand that will be uncorked as soon as vaccinations take effect and argue that the economy will roar back. Pessimists wonder if we have finally crossed the threshold of peak oil demand, which would leave producers fighting over a shrinking market. Joe Biden’s promises of climate action add to the trepidation. One early Biden action was to cancel the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, which would deliver oil from Alberta to Nebraska, and from there eventually to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Completing the pipeline would shift oil from rail transport to the objectively safer pipeline mode of transport. That said, a select group of U.S. producers saluted President Biden’s cancellation of the Keystone XL permit, thinking that the absence of the pipeline would keep Canadian crude off the trains it currently uses to access U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. And now those producers want to double down with import tariffs. This is nothing new. Harold Hamm advocated for oil tariffs during the Trump administration. North Dakota, where Hamm’s Continental Resources is an important producer, has had low prices for years relative to national benchmarks (Keystone XL would have helped by providing another way for North Dakota oil to get to market, reducing the price differential between crude produced there and elsewhere). Yet even the tariff-happy Trump administration could not stomach oil tariffs. It has been just over five years since the antiquated crude-oil export ban was scrapped. Yet here come West Texas oil producers asking for import barriers — maybe they don’t recall their advocacy of free trade a few years ago. We’ll deliver The Capital Note to your inbox each weekday. No charge. The oil-tariff idea has deeper roots, going back to the Suez Crisis during the Eisenhower administration. While those may seem like halcyon days for the U.S. oil industry, tariffs did not change the trajectory of long-term decline in domestic production. All the more ironic to revive this policy now, with the U.S. a net energy exporter for the first time in 75 years. Nonetheless, some producers are preparing to mount an effort to impose a tariff on oil imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the same authority that the Trump administration used to put tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Tariffs create problems. One is that the costs largely fall on our own consumers. The second is that, to the extent they affect foreign interests, they often hit friends and allies. In the case of oil, that means Canada, Mexico, and other neighbors. Since the beginning of 2020, over 85 percent of U.S. oil imports came from the Western Hemisphere, overwhelmingly from Canada and Mexico. What about Saudi Arabia and Venezuela? What about Russia? What about the other member states in OPEC? Actually, we really don’t import much oil from any of those places — the average over the past year is about 12 percent of total oil imports from all OPEC members. That might seem like a lot of oil to a single producer, but the global oil market is large and complex. The option to buy and sell on the global market provides American firms flexibility and is likely to help domestic prices on balance. It has been a rough year for the oil industry, but things are looking slightly better, even as clouds remain on the policy and economic horizons. The path to recovery does not wend through protectionism, certainly not when the United States is producing more energy than it can consume. Oil producers petitioning the new administration for tariffs are among the most desperate in the country, and they should prepare for disappointment.

Here’s a quote from an animal-rights activist from my book, A Rat Is a Pig Is a Dog Is a Boy: The Human Cost of the Animal Rights Movement, that illustrates the ubiquitous use of animal byproducts throughout various sectors of manufacturing and the economy: Today, the use of nonhuman animal products is so diverse and widespread that it is impossible to live in modern society and not support the nonhuman animal industry directly.  For example, the blood of a slaughtered cow is used to manufacture plywood adhesives, fertilizer, fire extinguisher foam, and dyes.  Her fat helps make plastic, tires, crayons, cosmetics, lubricants, soaps, detergents, cough syrup, contraceptive jellies and creams, ink, shaving cream, fabric softeners, synthetic rubber, jet engine lubricants, textiles, corrosion inhibitors, and metal-machining lubricants. Her collagen is found in pie crusts, yogurts, matches, bank notes, paper, and cardboard glue; her intestines are used in strings for musical instruments and racquets; her bones in charcoal ash for refining sugar, in ceramics, and cleaning and polishing compounds.  Medical and scientific uses abound.  And there is much, much more. This is an example of why we can’t let “the experts” decide.

Texas has lost significant fossil fuel generation capacity over the past several years and instead counted on nearly 20,000 MW of new wind and solar generation to satisfy steadily rising electricity demand. It has been known for years that a weather event combining low wind and solar production and record demand could lead to blackouts. This week, that event became reality as new wind and solar generation failed to produce when it was needed the most. As temperatures dropped further Sunday night and electricity demand started rising, wind generation also began to drop, eventually bottoming out at 2% of installed capacity last night. Preliminary data indicates conservation measures and rolling outages were not initiated quickly enough. Contrary to numerous false reports that coal and natural gas plants were also “frozen,” almost all those reliable generators were operating without interruption until this system failure, just as they do in much colder climates all over the world. This situation could have been avoided had ERCOT acted more swiftly — but it never would have been an issue had our grid not been so deeply penetrated by renewable energy sources that contribute the least when they are needed the most, yet are propped up by billions in taxpayer-funded subsidies every year. That’s why the Texas Public Policy Foundation has made it a priority in our Liberty Action Agenda to develop a market-based system that would require all electric generators to guarantee a certain amount of “dispatchable,” or readily available, power available to the grid at all times. We look forward to working with the Texas Legislature to preserve Texans’ access to affordable, reliable electricity no matter the weather. More here.",Why Texas Went Dark

In parts of Minnesota, temperatures dipped to near their lowest levels in a century. In Texas, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram is warning of “rolling blackouts” due to extreme cold. Green energy to the rescue, right? Hardly. As the Center for the American Experiment, a climate-skeptic Minnesota-based think tank has reported: “Wind turbines are shut down when temperatures are below -22° F because it is too cold to operate them safely. This means it will be too cold for the wind turbines built by the power companies to generate any electricity.” We’ll deliver The Capital Note to your inbox each weekday. No charge. They note that during the last Polar Vortex in 2019, wind and solar provided almost no power. Ergo: When you really need power and heating, wind and solar are out of commission. It’s worse than that.

During the 2019 Polar Vortex, wind turbines were consuming 2 MW of electricity. Wind turbines are a liability on the grid when the power is needed most. Solar power is even less reliable in severe weather conditions. Frigid temperatures are often associated with bright sunny skies, but the temperatures drop way down at night — you know, when there is no sunlight. Also, snow and ice often disable the panels.

Nationally, President Biden’s ban — for now, just described as a pause — on new oil and gas leases on federal lands has been well documented. So too has his revoking of the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. While such decisions are undoubtedly popular with radical environmentalists and their well-funded allies, it is hard to see how they — or anyone likely to follow them — will achieve the reductions in CO2 emissions necessary to make any difference to the climate. Look, for example, at the impact of the Keystone XL pipeline decision. With no available pipeline, Canada and its oil producers will simply load their oil onto trains or trucks, relying instead on modes of transport that are more risky and less energy-efficient. Indeed, doing so will involve higher greenhouse-gas emissions than the pipeline would have, especially considering the pipeline developers’ recent promise to use only renewable energy to operate the project. Overall, less than 10 percent of American oil and gas comes from federal lands. Cutting production from them won’t have a real impact on producers on private and state lands, nor will it reduce demand for foreign oil. Nevertheless, this new policy could end up inflicting significant economic pain on an already shaky U.S. economy. Even if a relatively small amount of U.S. oil and gas production comes from federal lands, bans or restrictions there will have a disproportionate effect on a good number of states and their economies (like my own in New Mexico). Half of New Mexico’s oil and gas production — much of it fracked — is on federal land. Long-term curtailment of oil and gas drilling on federal lands would devastate the state’s budget. Not to be outdone by the Biden administration, the Democrat-dominated legislature here in “deep blue” New Mexico is considering a number of proposals of their own. (Mind you, the state is one of the poorest in the Union and, thanks to fracking, is the country’s third-largest oil producer.) Chief among them is legislation that would require all new construction (homes and schools) in New Mexico to incorporate solar panels and mandate that 75 percent of all state-government vehicles be electric-only. Another bill would require dramatic reductions in “carbon intensity” for vehicles purchased by everyday New Mexicans. The technology to reduce carbon-intensity of New Mexico vehicles is left unsaid because the regulation would oblige fuel producers to work this out for themselves. Writing for the Albuquerque Journal, two Democratic state legislators explained the proposals: By requiring fuel providers that refine, blend, make or import fuel used in New Mexico to gradually reduce the carbon intensity of the transportation fuel itself, we can reduce emissions by 4.7 million metric tons in carbon dioxide equivalent by 2040. That’s like taking 44,000 cars off the road every year for 15 years. A clean fuel standard would not apply to retail gas stations or cause cost increases at the pump. Yet, the heavy-handed, economy-killing efforts in New Mexico and in various state capitals across the country will do little to rein in global CO2 emissions. In fact, CO2 emissions are already being curbed in the United States through a combination of market forces and government policies. The real problem is that emissions are exploding elsewhere, most notably in China. We’ll deliver The Capital Note to your inbox each weekday. No charge. In late 2020, Forbes noted that U.S. CO2 emissions already comply with the Paris agreement. Goosed by an 11 percent drop in CO2 emissions in 2020 due to COVID-19–induced travel reductions, the United States has seen emissions drop since the mid 1980s. Nowadays, despite a population that is 40 percent larger than it was in the mid 1980s, U.S. CO2emissions are approximately the same as they were back then. This is a remarkable feat. Indeed, the combination of a long-term shift in electricity generation from coal to natural gas (in no small part thanks to fracking), along with the energy efficiency generated both by market competition and regulatory pressure, fuel-mileage mandates, and the Clean Air Act, have made the United States a more CO2-efficient national economy. China, on the other hand, is not just rapidly increasing CO2 emissions, it is massively expanding coal-fired electricity production. According to Voice of America, “China put 38.4 gigawatts (GW) of new coal-fired power capacity into operation in 2020, more than three times the amount built elsewhere around the world and potentially undermining its short-term climate goals.” Furthermore, according to research released on Wednesday by Global Energy Monitor, China’s coal-fired fleet capacity rose by a net 29.8 GW in 2020 (including decommissions), even as the rest of the world made cuts of 17.2 GW. China, which still has millions of citizens living in real poverty, certainly has a right to develop its economy. But if the Biden administration is serious about addressing climate change, it ought to use the bully pulpit to cajole China to move toward lower CO2 intensity. After all, China is already the global “leader,” with CO2 emissions approximately doubling those of the United States. Those emissions rose even during the pandemic year of 2020. Even if the Biden administration and states such as New Mexico make a concerted and focused effort to reduce CO2emissions (an open question to say the least), the United States won’t be able to halt climate change. Any CO2 reduction we make is only displaced by a doubling from China, who seems more serious about developing its own economy than the Biden administration and many “blue” states like New Mexico are about theirs. President Joe Biden and New Mexico governor Michelle Lujan Grisham telling us to pay more for energy while destroying thousands of energy jobs is a hard pill to swallow even if we were to make serious progress toward achieving our climate goals. But to do immense damage to the U.S. and New Mexico economies while allowing American progress on CO2 emissions to be undermined by our economic and geopolitical rivals in China is woefully misbegotten.

Executive Orders from the Oval Office, Directives of the European Union, or Acts of Parliament driven through with fanfare by Her Majesty’s Government in London may give the plausible appearance that wishes are horses and beggars may ride, and in comfort too, but it is no more than appearance. As Richard Feynman, the great laughing natural-philosopher of our age, observed with savage economy after the Challenger disaster: “For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.” Physics matters. It was not a random or arbitrary fluctuation, much less political favor or the power of vested interest, that led coal to dominate British energy supply as early as 1700, eroding the status of a deeply resistant landed aristocracy and gentry. It was not thanks to politicians that in the following centuries coal, oil, and gas established an overwhelming position in global energy supply. On the contrary, it was the intrinsic physical properties of those fuels that led to their preferment, properties which can be summed up in a single term: Fossil fuels are of low entropy. They are, in the technical, thermodynamic sense, highly improbable, being dense stocks of energy, the improbability of which can be rendered in a multitude of changes to the world in accordance with human wishes, improbable changes that we call wealth. And if the low-carbon candidates to replace those fossil fuels do not have similarly favorable or superior physical properties, no amount of policy support will be able to compensate for the deficiency. Nature cannot be fooled. Reality matters. But what is the reality of renewable energy? In one of his first actions as president, Mr. Biden has expressed the wish to “double” offshore wind in the U.S. by 2030, an ambiguous phrase that probably means he and his advisers wish to see twice the current development portfolio of offshore wind capacity to be operational within a decade, or 18,000 MW rather than the present 9,000 MW in an advanced stage of preparation. The attraction is easily explained. The U.S. already has a great deal of onshore wind power, 112,000 MW, subsidized through Production Tax Credits and mostly located on and around a line running from North Dakota to Texas, a broad belt characterized by strong winds, cheapish land, and low construction costs. Unfortunately, it is also distant from the main corridors of demand on the East and West coasts. Offshore wind along the coasts therefore seems like a tempting option for expansion, but is it wise? The U.S. has almost no experience with offshore wind, with only two small projects completed, totaling 42 MW, about 0.2 percent of Mr Biden’s apparent aspirational 2030 target for this technology. However, this need not be a leap in the dark. In pursuit of relevant data, the U.S. can look to Europe, and particularly to the United Kingdom, which already has 10,000 MW of wind deployed in the British seas, some dating back to the early 2000s. Nearly everything the U.S. might wish to know is there. Extracting that information, however, will not be straightforward since the British government and the wind industry are colluding in an obfuscation of the truth. Both sides claim that costs are falling, the government because it is reluctant to admit failure after many tens of billions of dollars of subsidy, the industry because its participants hope to survive long enough to be rescued out by a future government so desperate that it provides new (and probably covert) subsidies. Fortunately, one can obtain the economic facts of the offshore and indeed the onshore wind story, which is also discouraging, from the public filings of audited accounts. Professor Gordon Hughes of the Department of Economics at the University of Edinburgh has undertaken this analysis for over 350 companies that own and operate wind farms, covering a period of over 15 years. The work is published by the charity, Renewable Energy Foundation, which I direct, and is freely available from the REF website: Wind Power Economics: Rhetoric and Reality. The analysis finds that offshore capital construction costs rose steadily until the early 2010s and show no sign of a sharp decline thereafter. The following figure charts the actual costs (pounds per MW of capacity at 2018 prices) for offshore wind in the U.K. including transmission connections (vertical axis) against cumulative installed capacity in Europe (horizontal axis), thus putting to the test the widely held belief that due to economies of scale and learning average costs will fall as installed capacity increases. We’ll deliver The Capital Note to your inbox each weekday. No charge. As a matter of recorded fact, costs have increased by about 15 percent for every doubling in total wind capacity in North Western Europe, mostly because of the necessity of using sites that are more distant from shore and in deeper water, requirements from which the U.S. would not be immune. Professor Hughes finds that these trends greatly outweigh any reductions in cost due to the use of larger turbines. Of particular interest to the United States is the outlier in the figure, which represents a floating wind-turbine project, Hywind, the costs of which are double the average for fixed turbines in deep water. The majority of the available U.S. offshore wind resource flows over waters more than 60 meters deep, ruling out seabed foundations. But more important still than capital expenditure are the trends in operational costs. The data collected from the audited accounts of wind farm companies reveals not only that such costs rise for a wind project as it ages, which ought to be unsurprising, but also that they have tended to rise over time for new projects. It is these trends in operational costs that are critical to the lifetime economics of a wind farm, on- or offshore, though with particularly marked consequences for the latter and for obvious reasons: the sea is proverbially “cruel,” viciously so to electrical and mechanical equipment. The following figure charts the evolution of average operating costs (expressed in £ per year per MW at 2018 prices) for typical offshore projects. The analysis allows for turbine size, water depth, and the arrangements for grid connection. The blue line shows the costs for a project in shallow water (less than ten meters depth) installed in 2008, while the gray line describes the operational costs for a deep-water wind farm (greater than 30 meters depth) built in 2018. As can be seen, the operating cost when aged one year for the deep-water project is some 60 percent higher than for a shallow-water project. Indeed, the data suggest that the operating costs have increased by about 6 per cent annually over the period 2008 to 2018. Operating costs also rise sharply as a wind farm ages, by about 5.5 per cent in real terms for each year of service. The result is that even if the wind turbine performance does not decline with age, the average operating cost per megawatt-hour of electrical energy generated will exceed the expected revenue from market prices shortly after twelve years, well below the 20 and 30 year Cost Recovery Periods assumed by, for example, the U.S. National Renewable Laboratory (NREL) in their models. U.K. offshore wind capital expenditures and operating costs of the order actually recorded in 2018–2019 imply a breakeven price of £152/MWh ($206/MWh). These projects receive a subsidized price of £161/MWh. That is four times the current wholesale price, and greatly in excess of the prices nominated and bid by developers of future wind projects as acceptable to them in a Contract for Difference (CfD), a complex scheme which guarantees but also caps the price per MWh that the wind farm can obtain for its output. These CfD bids averaged at £112/MWh ($150/MWh) and £65/MWh ($88/MWh) in CfD Allocation Rounds 1 and 2 respectively. To break even at these lower prices one must either assume unrealistically high levels of availability and productivity (load factor) or an unlikely reversal in the observed cost trends. Demands for a bailout appear all but certain. Real-world experience in the U.K. and indeed in Denmark, a country also analyzed in great detail in the Hughes study for REF, presents a stark warning to the United States; the costs of wind power have not been falling over the last heavily subsidized decade. Indeed, they remain very high, particularly for offshore wind, with operational expenditure actually rising sharply. While only now beginning to enter public-policy debate, these points are in fact understood by many market and financial analysts, with fragments of the information circulating in confidential newsletters. The markets know, however obscurely, and Mr. Biden should bear that in mind before putting the U.S. consumer and taxpayer on the hook for a large expansion of offshore wind. This will be very expensive electricity, even before the cost of managing an increasingly stochastic grid network is taken into account. The real puzzle here is how first-class scientific nations could have gone so far down a road that is intrinsically, physically, without strong promise. Why did any policymaker think that it would be cheap to convert the high entropy, almost random heat of wind flows into the low entropy of the improbable, reliable and timely electricity supply required by a sophisticated economy? Large capital expenditure and operating costs, as well as significant grid costs, are inevitable if governments insist on making the sow’s ear of wind into the silk purse of modern energy. This planning failure is more than a question of painful domestic economics and inadequate climate policy. The broader hazards of driving the U.S. towards renewable energy are brought into sharp focus by increasingly intense competition from a China whose president has admitted that its emissions from low entropy, but high emitting, fossil fuels will continue to rise until 2030 and remain substantial for some considerable time thereafter, with the country only aspiring to become carbon neutral in 2060. If China fulfills that aspiration, it will be on its own terms and no other: There is every reason to think that Beijing is making an end run around renewables, dressing the window with what are, for that gargantuan national system, mere traces of wind and solar, while in reality concentrating on the accumulation of great wealth from fossil fuels, now rendered cheap by coerced exclusion from the Western markets. With that wealth in hand, China will deploy advanced nuclear to generate both electricity and hydrogen on the largest possible scale so as to honor its longer-term climate change promises while simultaneously securing its economic, military, and geopolitical preeminence. A nuclear China would be richer, stronger, and cleaner than any of its competitors.  The engineer bureaucrats of Beijing know nature far too well to think that she can be fooled. The lawyers and ideologues in the White House take a different view, for now.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ruled against Pembina, a midstream oil and gas company, in its appeal of an Oregon state-government ruling denying the company a permit to export liquefied natural gas (LNG). Pembina’s proposal for a project at Jordan Cove, 150 miles southwest of Portland, includes a pipeline, liquefaction plant, and shipping terminal. It would be the first Pacific-facing LNG export site in the lower 48 and received a provisional green light from FERC itself in March 2020, but its hopes now appear to be dashed. The economic value of a project like Jordan Cove is obvious. The majority of the world’s population and its new energy demand are in Asia. Existing U.S. LNG-export facilities are all situated on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, which, while well situated for growing trade with Europe, leaves Asia-bound cargos bottlenecked at the increasingly congested Panama Canal. A shipment from Jordan Cove could reach Tokyo in just nine days, according to Pembina, roughly 50 percent faster than LNG cargos sent from Gulf Coast terminals. This winter’s cold snaps have driven demand for LNG in Asia sky-high, but canal constraints have left cargos languishing in the tropics for weeks as they await passage. The promise of Jordan Cove has never been more apparent. Contrary to the claims of the project’s opponents such as the Niskanen Center’s David Bookbinder, Jordan Cove would provide an export outlet for gas producers from across the Western United States. Bookbinder claims that the project’s only justification is profit for Canada-based Pembina. “Ultimately,” he told an Oregon public radio station last year, “this is all for the benefit of a Canadian corporation and for moving Canadian natural gas.” If true, that might mean the Jordan Cove project is not in the U.S.’ public interest. But the claim is false. The project would connect Jordan Cove via a new pipeline to an existing natural-gas hub at Malin, Ore. The Malin hub would link the region and enable producers from states such as Colorado and Wyoming to access the Asian market. Wyoming governor Mark Gordon described the project as “vital” for his state, and Colorado’s Mesa County commissioners said that Jordan Cove would “help stabilize the economies of rural communities in both Oregon and Northwest Colorado for decades to come.” We’ll deliver The Capital Note to your inbox each weekday. No charge. The Niskanen Center’s opposition to the use of eminent domain to push the project through is valid, but its assertion that there would be no benefit to Oregonians is mendacious. To take just one benefit, the project developer entered an agreement with Coos County to pay $12 million annually toward a Community Enhancement Plan. Further, Jordan Cove would generate thousands of construction jobs in the near term and hundreds of long-term jobs to staff its facilities. Indeed, Jordan Cove exemplifies the sort of project Coos County envisioned when it established its enterprise-zone program. Of course, the real resistance to Jordan Cove is over climate. No matter how respectful of the local environment, no matter how beneficial to the community, Jordan Cove was bound to face fierce opposition because natural gas violates our new climate catechism. Building a pipeline and export terminal abets global warming — or so the argument goes. What the opponents of Jordan Cove misunderstand is that LNG shipped to Asia would largely serve their cause. Shipping gas across the Pacific increases the likelihood that China and Japan will reduce their reliance on coal. China, despite its pledge to be carbon neutral by 2060, burns a quarter of all the coal used globally, despite making up less than 20 percent of the world’s population. Japan, wary of nuclear energy after the fiasco at Fukushima Daiichi, now uses more coal than it did 20 years ago. The U.S., on the other hand, has reduced coal consumption by 45 percent since 2008 thanks to domestic production of natural gas. But to Oregon’s activists and those taking control of U.S. policy this month, no analysis beyond “hydrocarbons bad” is admissible. Even accepting the premises of climate activists, exporting natural gas to Asia is a positive. That’s why Canada — which has a carbon tax — is building 13 LNG terminals in British Columbia alone. Market conditions, such as they are, provide an opportunity for North Americans to export an in-demand commodity. Remove Pompeiian references to “molecules of freedom” and the economics remain. But whereas the Canadian government has seized the opportunity, the blue wall of legislatures and governors that control California, Oregon, and Washington State have left North American infrastructure developers scrambling. The result is convoluted arrangements such as the deal between San Diego-based Sempra Energy and Mexico to export LNG from a terminal in Baja California. The terminal will be Mexico’s first for LNG export; it will receive American natural gas by pipeline and ship it to Asia from just 40 miles south of the U.S. border. With allies now taking up posts in the nation’s capital, governors Newsom, Brown, and Inslee have no counterweight against their power over the states of the U.S. interior and the energy producers operating within them. Asia is hungry for natural gas and U.S. reserves are plentiful, but a $10 billion project is now on ice. Thanks to misguided climate politics, a golden energy-export opportunity is slipping away.

394,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/14-state-ags-claim-bidens-keystone-pipeline-decision-will-result-in-devastating-damage/,NR,Far Right,"A group of 14 state attorneys general sent a letter to President Biden on Tuesday urging him to reconsider his revocation of the Keystone XL pipeline permit, saying the president’s decision will harm thousands of American workers as well as the country at large. “Your decision will result in devastating damage to many of our states and local communities. Even those states outside the path of the Keystone XL pipeline—indeed all Americans—will suffer serious, detrimental consequences,” the attorneys general wrote in the letter. On his first day in office, Biden revoked former President Trump’s 2019 presidential permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline, construction of which has been halted and resumed repeatedly over several administrations. The pipeline is planned to span 1,700 miles from Alberta to the Texas Gulf Coast when completed, transporting about 800,000 barrels of oil per day through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma. Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen led the coalition of attorneys general in sending Biden the letter. In Montana, the pipeline will cover 285 miles and six counties. We’ll deliver The Capital Note to your inbox each weekday. No charge. “In Montana for instance, killing Keystone XL will likely cost the state approximately $58 million in annual tax revenue. Montana will lose the benefits of future easements and leases, and several local counties will lose their single-biggest property taxpayer. The loss of Keystone XL’s economic activity and tax revenues are especially devastating as five of the six impacted counties are designated high-poverty areas,” Knudsen led the attorneys general in writing. The coalition of attorneys general also warned Biden that the affected states are weighing their legal options to protect their residents in the wake of the administration’s decision. “Please be aware that the states are reviewing available legal options to protect our residents and sovereign interests,” they wrote. “In the meantime, we urge you to reconsider your decision to impose crippling economic injuries on states, communities, families, and workers across the country.” Last month, White House climate czar John Kerry recommended that oil and gas workers should pivot to manufacturing solar panels if their jobs are eliminated as a consequence of the Biden administration’s environmental policies. Construction of the pipeline would have created about 11,000 U.S. jobs this year, according to the Keystone XL website. Many of the workers are temporary, but 8,000 are union workers.

The Cotton-Romney Plan to Raise the Minimum Wage Without Killing Jobs The Cotton-Romney Deal: $10 Minimum Wage for Immigration Enforcement A Compromise on Nominations Last week, President Biden signed an executive order that set the goal of “doubling offshore wind by 2030,” as a part of his administration’s aim to boost renewable-energy production. Environmental reporter Timothy Cama nicely summed up the audacity of that goal, writing: “So from seven turbines to fourteen?” Doubling offshore wind production would mean advancing our current capacity of powering 0.0143 percent of 140 million American homes to a new capacity of powering 0.0286 percent of them. There are currently no utility-scale wind farms in operation in the U.S. The five turbines of the pilot project Block Island Wind Farm, actually in state waters off Rhode Island, came online in 2016 and generate 30 megawatts, enough energy to power 17,000 homes. The two-turbine Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, with 12 megawatts of capacity, was completed last year and can power up to 3,000 homes. Nearly a full decade should be plenty of time to double the current 42 megawatts, but given regulatory and logistical barriers, setting such a low bar was likely purposeful. The new administration’s offshore wind approach highlights how it’s pushing a few policies that may be good politics but make little economic sense — and at times conflict with each other. For starters, Congress recently clarified that the Jones Act applies to offshore wind projects, a regulatory answer that some in the industry had been awaiting for years. The Act, originally signed in 1920, compels ships traveling between U.S. ports to be American built, owned, registered, and crewed. It garnered headlines in 2017 when it made the U.S.’ hurricane response in Puerto Rico slower and more costly than it should have been. It is also the reason that the island and some states have begun importing Russian energy in recent years — there are no liquefied natural gas tankers that meet the Act’s requirements. According to a December report from the Government Accountability Office, the wind sector faces a similar problem. There are no Jones Act-compliant vessels capable of installing the jumbo turbines needed for the many wind projects already planned in the Atlantic. The report diagrams a potentially workable — albeit facetious-sounding — alternative: Have a foreign ship arrive at the installation site, use a crane to pick up turbines and other components from U.S.-compliant “feeder ships,” and then install the equipment. We’ll deliver The Capital Note to your inbox each weekday. No charge. The feeder-ship approach was successfully used in the Block Island project because Customs and Border Protection ruled that lifting components with a Maltese vessel’s crane was not considered “movement of merchandise.” But the GAO identifies several remaining hurdles: There are likely no U.S. feeder ships large enough to complete bigger wind projects, many existing foreign-flagged installation vessels are also too small, and demand for wind projects in Europe and Asia will mean plenty of competition for what capacity is available. (The report notes that one U.S. company plans to build a single installation vessel, at a cost of $500 million and a timeline of three years.) You would think that after trumpeting its offshore wind plans, the Biden administration would be screaming for a repeal of the protectionist and counterproductive Jones Act. Instead, the president reiterated his “strong support” for the law when endorsing one of the slew of other executive orders he has so far signed. The reality is that the new administration had to offer up some sort of goal for renewables given the truly audacious action Biden also made in his order: pausing all oil and gas leasing on federal lands and offshore waters, likely a first step in the pursuit of a ban on fossil fuel exploration and drilling. Such a ban was one of his boldest campaign promises, and one that will doubtless be accompanied by massive trade-offs — including squeezing budgets of states that rely on energy and threatening funds for national parks repairs and other conservation aims that have been juiced by oil and gas receipts for decades. In 2019, federal revenues from wind energy were $411 million. That was about 1/25th of the roughly $10 billion in revenue generated by oil and gas. If the new administration really aims to start to displace that fossil fuel money with proceeds from renewables, it should be leading a charge to get rid of the anachronistic Jones Act.

398,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-biden-jobs-purge/,NR,Far Right,"No, no, the Biden administration does not represent some sort of return to Bolshevism (nothing like), but something about its willingness to insist on ‘short-term’ sacrifice in pursuit of a radiant green future unmoored to any kind of reality is faintly reminiscent of the ruthlessness of an earlier generation of millenarians — red rather than green — a century ago. Fox News: President Biden climate advisor Gina McCarthy said Wednesday that the administration is “not asking for sacrifice” with its executive order to shut down construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. According to the Keystone XL website, the project, initially proposed more than a decade ago, would have sustained about 11,000 U.S. jobs in 2021 – including 8,000 union jobs – and generated $1.6 billion in gross wages. Not to worry though: “The most exciting thing about this is we’re not asking for sacrifice here,” McCarthy said during a Wednesday interview on NBC’s “TODAY Show.” “The president fully understands that people are suffering now. So this [is] all about recovering from the COVID crisis. This [is] all about building good, clean jobs, jobs where you can get access to jobs to good pay and unions.” Translation (after ignoring McCarthy’s effort to muddle the issue by bringing COVID-19 into the discussion): We are asking for sacrifice, but don’t worry, green jobs will come to the rescue, a promise that will doubtless comfort a fortysomething oil worker, whose skills may not quite be as transferable as all that. Gina Raimondo, Biden’s nominee for secretary of commerce, said during a Tuesday confirmation hearing before the Senate that the Biden administration will ensure union workers who lost jobs due to the blocking of the XL pipeline will get new jobs. Quite how, in a free-market economy, she can “ensure” that such workers will get new jobs is beyond me. But perhaps a free market is not what we are talking about. Somehow I suspect that the unions whose members’ jobs flow(ed) from the Keystone project don’t seem to be entirely convinced about the green-jobs bonanza that the Biden administration would like us to believe lies just around the corner: KOMO News: President Joe Biden won an estimated 57 percent of union households across America in last year’s election, but one of his earliest actions in the White House on Wednesday a flurry of criticism from leading labor groups: his executive order revoking federal permitting for the long-delayed Keystone XL pipeline project. “Deeply disappointed,” said the head of the North American Building Trades Unions, which endorsed Mr. Biden in October. “Will kill thousands of good-paying #UNION jobs!” tweeted the Laborers’ International Union of North America. “Sadly, the Biden Administration has now put thousands of union workers out of work,” lamented the United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters. Given Biden’s climate crusade, there will be many more job losses to come. The green new dole will be what it will be. From the Wall Street Journal: Any doubt that the Biden Administration plans to slowly regulate fossil fuels out of existence vanished this week. First came the Keystone XL pipeline kill, but perhaps more significant is the 60-day freeze on new leases on federal lands and bureaucratic permitting. The pause could soon become a long-term ban. Federal lands account for about 22% of U.S. oil production, 12% of natural gas and 40% of coal. When the Obama Administration slowed oil and gas permitting on federal land, drilling and exploration shifted to private land. The Biden Administration may shut that down too. Start with the 60-day suspension on new leases on federal land. Producers in older oil and gas fields won’t be significantly affected, and many have already scaled back investment in places like California and Louisiana while pouring more into shale. But shale fracking occurs in large part on federal land in western states, and it continually requires new leases and investment. Federal land accounts for 51.9% of New Mexico’s oil production and 66.8% of its natural gas, as well as a sizable share of gas extraction in Colorado (41.6%), Utah (63.2%) and Wyoming (92.1%). A federal leasing ban would cost some 18,000 jobs in Colorado, 33,000 in Wyoming and 62,000 in New Mexico by 2022, according to the American Petroleum Institute. States would also lose hundreds of millions of dollars of mineral royalties that are shared by the feds. Oil and gas revenue accounts for 20% of New Mexico’s budget. Downstream suppliers like fracking sand mines in Wisconsin and steel manufacturers in Pennsylvania would also be hit . . . For more on the difficulties that are, specifically, likely heading New Mexico’s way, take a look at Paul Gessing’s article for Capital Matters last month. Those splendid new green jobs are going to have to materialize very quickly, and, some states must hope, in the right places. Count me skeptical.

The company has pledged to become carbon-neutral by 2040, and has greatly expanded investment in electric vehicles in recent months. The transition to production of only electric vehicles would mark a seismic shift in the U.S. auto industry, and especially within GM, whose bestselling products include large SUV’s. The announcement comes as various governments around the world, including Japan and the U.K., have said they will ban gas-fueled cars by 2035, due to fears of global warming. California governor Gavin Newsom signed an executive order in September 2020 aiming to ban the sale of gas-fueled cars in the state by that year. Toyota president Akio Toyoda warned against a full transition in December 2020, saying that cars would need electricity generated by coal-fired power plants, driving up greenhouse gas emissions, and that high demand for electricity would crash Japan’s electric grid.

The Chinese government says otherwise. On Wednesday, newly confirmed Secretary of State Antony Blinken and John Kerry, the president’s special envoy on climate, both made remarks on the administration’s plans to negotiate with the Chinese. At the White House, Kerry addressed some of the concerns that have been raised about the administration’s approach, stating that the U.S. position on issues such as the South China Sea dispute and intellectual-property theft “will never be traded for anything that has to do with climate.” “That’s not going to happen,” he continued, “But climate is a critical, standalone issue.” Blinken later in the afternoon similarly defended the administration’s intention to negotiate with the Chinese on climate issues, which he said is a topic “where it’s in the interest of China and in the interest of the United States and the interest of countries around the world to make concrete progress in combating global warming.” “I think and hope that we’ll be able to pursue that,” he added. We’ll deliver The Capital Note to your inbox each weekday. No charge. But just how much of a standalone issue can climate actually be? And is it true, as Blinken argued, that it can be an area of cooperation? The Chinese Foreign Ministry answered Blinken and Kerry today, according to the Global Times, a Party tabloid: Neither side should expect to wantonly interfere in China’s internal affairs and undermine China’s interest, while at the same time demanding China’s support in bilateral and global affairs, said China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday. “China-US cooperation in specific areas is not just ‘flower in a greenhouse.’ It is bound to be closely related to the overall China-US relations. China hopes the US can create favorable conditions for China-US coordination and cooperation in important areas,” Zhao Lijian, spokesperson for the ministry noted at a daily press briefing on Thursday. Kerry can’t simply wave away the concerns that climate negotiations with Beijing will require U.S. concessions in other, unrelated areas if the Chinese government publicly demands such concessions with regard to “interference in China’s internal affairs” (which is to say human rights). This raises some important questions: Why bother to claim that climate negotiations can work without significant concessions if that’s most likely not true? And just what, and how much, is the Biden administration willing to sacrifice in order to strike a bargain with the CCP on climate?",Climate Negotiations with Beijing Won’t Come without Significant Concessions

The alleged “climate emergency” touches virtually every aspect of economic life. This executive overreach would almost surely spark litigation from numerous states. It would also undermine regulatory stability, as each successive president either imposes decrees or undoes the policies imposed by previous administrations, leaving a perpetually shifting regulatory environment (which we already, to a significant extent, have). This is not the way the United States is supposed to be governed. While there are many substantive policy problems with declaring a “climate emergency,” there are also constitutional ones. Last year, presidential candidate Biden rightly argued that “you can’t [legislate] by executive order unless you’re a dictator. We’re a democracy. We need consensus.” When President Trump relied on emergency powers to redirect military funds to build portions of his border fence, we noted that it was “unwelcome step in America’s long march toward unilateral government by the executive.” At the time, Schumer agreed, calling it “an outrageous power grab by a president who refuses to accept the constitutional separation of powers.” We’ll deliver The Capital Note to your inbox each weekday. No charge. What’s changed? Nothing other than the names of the parties and the scope of power being grabbed. Biden has promised to transform the United States into a 100 percent clean-energy economy with net-zero emissions by 2050 and to decarbonize the power sector in a mere 15 years. The massive cost of policies that deny Americans affordable and abundant energy sources would almost certainly fail to win approval in Congress under its usual rules. Which is why Democrats are doing everything they can to short-circuit or make an end-run around the system. The majority leader told MSNBC that Democrats were also trying to figure out ways to sneak climate-change policy into Biden’s “Build Back Better” plan under reconciliation, a budget tactic that allows some spending-related bills to pass with only a simple majority in the Senate. Depending on the particulars, that might be an abuse of the process, and would likely be objectionable on policy grounds, but would at least involve congressional action. Biden has already done much to advance his climate agenda via pen and phone. He issued a slew of consequential climate-related executive orders, rejoining the Paris climate agreement without Senate ratification, enacting a moratorium on new federal oil and gas leases, and shutting down the Keystone XL pipeline by revoking permits for the project. This would only be a taste of the job-killing initiatives he’d undertake after declaring a “climate emergency.” Biden, remember, has previously stated that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal offers the “crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.” Climate change is not an existential threat that warrants a declaration of emergency. If Schumer wants to tackle the problem, he presides over the world’s most powerful legislative body. He is free to try to build consensus, compromise, and pass enduring federal legislation. Or not. Whatever the case, it’s certainly not his job to implore the executive branch to take yet more unilateral power at the expense of the Congress.",Against a ‘Climate Emergency’ Power Grab
402,https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/climate-change-does-not-mean-job-creation/,NR,Far Right,"On the menu today: After canceling the Keystone Pipeline and eliminating 1,000 jobs, the Biden administration says climate change means job creation; Biden continues to characterize tax-code provisions designed to increase domestic energy production as “handouts”; Biden wants federal agencies to purchase more electric vehicles, whether or not those agencies say those vehicles work well for them; the CDC says they’re still trying to figure out why there are “many vaccines that are sort of unaccounted for”; and a quick observation on the stock price of GameStop. Fact-Checking ‘Climate Day’ in the Biden Administration Yesterday, President Biden announced, “Today is ‘Climate Day’ at the White House and — which means that today is ‘Jobs Day’ at the White House. We’re talking about American innovation, American products, American labor.” Biden’s chief climate adviser, former Obama-era EPA administrator Gina McCarthy, added, “when we say, ‘climate change,’ eventually, people are going to think ‘jobs,’ just like President Biden when he hears the words ‘climate change.’” The problem is that Biden’s first major move on climate, canceling the Keystone Pipeline, already eliminated 1,000 jobs, according to TC Energy. And defenders of the Biden administration are being ludicrously disingenuous when they insist that “most of the [Keystone Pipeline] jobs would be temporary.” Yes, all construction jobs are temporary. (It only seems like the contractor working on your kitchen is taking forever.) When the construction crew has built what they’ve been assigned to build, that job is over, and they have to find a new one. The Biden administration answer to those 1,000 laid-off workers is to tell them to find other jobs. A week ago, the incoming transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, declared in his confirmation hearing, “We are very eager to see those workers continue to be employed in good-paying union jobs, even if they might be different ones.” And yesterday, “Special Climate Envoy” John Kerry suggested that coal miners could and would easily transition into the solar-power industry: “You know, you look at the consequences of black lung for a miner, for instance, and measure that against the fastest-growing job in the United States before COVID was solar power technician. The same people can do those jobs, but the choice of doing the solar power one now is a better choice.” Elsewhere in the day, Biden continued to characterize existing U.S. energy policy as “handouts” to oil companies. “Unlike previous administrations, I don’t think the federal government should give handouts to big oil to the tune of $40 billion in fossil fuel subsidies. And I’m going to be going to the Congress asking them to eliminate those subsidies.” We’ll deliver The Capital Note to your inbox each weekday. No charge. When Biden says “handouts,” you may be picturing the U.S. government handing a check to oil companies. What Biden is actually referring to are provisions in the tax code that were all designed to increase domestic energy production, reduce dependency on foreign sources, and reduce the cost to consumers. When Biden says he’s going to “stop giving them federal subsidies,” what he means is that he wants to change the tax code so that domestic production of oil and natural gas becomes more expensive. Electric Cars for Everyone! Except High-Level Government Officials, of Course Yesterday, Biden also said, “the federal government owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles, as you all know. With today’s executive order, combined with the Buy American executive order I signed on Monday, we’re going to harness the purchasing power of the federal government to buy clean, zero-emission vehicles that are made and sourced by union workers right here in America. With everything I just mentioned, this will mean one million new jobs in the American automobile industry. One million.” Every time the U.S. government makes a decision to purchase one new kind of vehicle, it is choosing not to purchase the old kind of vehicle. Purchasing a few thousand more electric vehicles means not purchasing a few thousand traditional vehicles. Purchasing electric cars will indeed create new jobs as U.S. manufacturers increase production to meet the government’s demand for them, but it will also eliminate jobs as manufacturers decrease production for the old cars. The U.S. government’s vehicle fleet varies from 640,000 to 645,000, with roughly 225,000 sedans, minivans, and SUVs, 412,000 trucks, and about 8,000 ambulances and buses. About 200,000 of those trucks are used by the U.S. Postal Service. The overall size of the fleet increases or decreases by 20,000 in a big year and by 1,000 in a stable year. During the Obama years, government purchasing offices were gradually reducing the percentage of government vehicles that were “conventional,” and in 2015, Obama signed an executive order directing federal agencies to reduce per-mile greenhouse gas emissions and increase acquisitions of electric vehicles; Trump repealed that order in 2018. According to the General Accounting Office, some federal agencies would like to buy electric vehicles, but the ones on the market don’t make financial sense or fit their needs: First, while hybrid and electric vehicles can offer reductions in petroleum use and greenhouse gas emissions, the costs of these vehicles and their charging infrastructure make it challenging for agencies to acquire them on a large scale. According to GSA data, agencies purchased 373 electric vehicles (sedans and minivans) in fiscal year 2017 — along with about 4,500 hybrid electric sedans — out of a total of over 16,000 sedans and minivans acquired. In total, agencies spent about $10.5 million more to purchase hybrid or electric vehicles than they would have to purchase comparably sized conventionally fueled vehicles. However, agencies did not consistently track the life-cycle costs of these vehicles. Second, agencies also stated that a lack of fuel and infrastructure availability limits agencies’ use of alternative fuel. Third, agency officials stated that a continuing need for larger vehicles limits the number of low greenhouse-gas-emitting vehicles agencies can acquire. Biden is unlikely to be stepping into an electric vehicle anytime soon. Back in 2010, President Obama inquired about the government purchasing a hybrid-powered limousine, but the U.S. Secret Service deemed the idea unfeasible: Obama told Litzler the Secret Service rejected his request for hybrid limousines because “the cars that I’m in are like tanks . . . They’re a little reinforced. They weigh twice or three times what an ordinary car weighs. So, they just couldn’t get the performance, in terms of acceleration, using a hybrid engine.” The Secret Service purchases a lot of vehicles besides the presidential limo. The presidential motorcade usually includes about 20 to 30 vehicles, and requires a massive amount of preparation: The presidential motorcade is built from a fleet of both custom and sometimes rented vehicles. A finite amount of presidential limousines exist, with between 16 and 20 being an estimate. Careful planning and a logistical symphony has to take place in order to pre-position the most capable (and usually newest) vehicles based on the threat level and operating environment at each destination. It is not uncommon of for the President to visit three separate cities during a single day, especially during campaign season. That means three separate motorcade detachments need to be forward deployed to those cities. This is done via USAF heavy-transports such as C-17s, or on some occasions, a single C-5 Galaxy. Wait, Where Are the Vaccines? I caught this exchange on yesterday’s The Lead with Jake Tapper, and I’m wondering why the new director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still trying to figure out how much vaccine is available: JAKE TAPPER: Sanjay, there seems to be some confusion about the location of some of these vaccines. Dr. Walensky from the CDC says they’re focused on — quote – ‘understanding where in the pipeline the vaccine actually is.’ How is it possible that so many vaccines are unaccounted for?DR. SANJAY GUPTA: Well, this is a real problem. I mean, Jake, this is a — vaccines are the most precious commodity really anywhere on the planet right now. And there’s many vaccines that are sort of unaccounted for. What we’re learning as we’re sort of digging into this is that the vaccines went to states. And that was sort of tracked by the software platform known as Tiberius. So it kind of knew the vaccine numbers that were going to states.But then, after that, it became a little bit muddled, because states were handling this differently. Some states were automatically holding back second doses within the state. So, they had been distributed to states, but obviously not being administered.So, that’s caused some of this confusion. You also — as I’m learning, the data that we see from the CDC is oftentimes lagging. It takes time to collect all this data from the states. So, by the time we actually see an aggregate data set, it may be several days or even a week behind. And that’s a problem as well.So, even if we look at the numbers on the screen in terms of overall doses administered, that may not reflect this point in time exactly. So, we have to take that into account. At the beginning of the week, I noted that Pfizer and Moderna had to know how many doses were shipped and what pace they can continue. Later that day, a reporter asked Jen Psaki, “[General] Gus Perna still works here, right? . . . And he’s in charge of the logistics. So could he say how much vaccine there is, since they’re in charge of where it’s going?” Now it appears the issue is that the vaccine gets distributed to the states, and then . . . everyone seems to lose track of it, apparently. ADDENDUM: If you’re confused about why so many people in the investing world are freaking out about “Redditors” and a bonkers jump in the stock price of GameStop, join the club. I’ll just point out a few things. If GameStop was less than $10 per share for most of the past two years, and nothing has changed the fundamental outlook for the company, then sooner or later it’s going to go back to less than $10. As of this writing, a single share of GameStop costs $347, meaning someone’s made a fortune virtually overnight. Someone who’s purchasing it at its current price is going to lose a fortune, really fast, unless the fundamentals of the company change. As anyone who’s ever tried to sell a house has learned, the value of what you have is limited by what someone is willing to pay for it. It doesn’t matter what Zillow or Redfin or your realtor says, and it isn’t really shaped by how much other homes in your neighborhood have sold for in the past year. If it’s worth $300,000 on paper, but no one is willing to pay that amount, your house cannot sell for that price, it can only sell for a lesser price. As of this writing, there are people who are willing to pay more than $300 for a share of GameStop, because everyone is swept up in this “let’s stick it to the short-selling hedge-funds” exuberance. But someday — maybe today! — that exuberance will stop. This is a classic speculative bubble, and you can pick your metaphor — musical chairs, hot potato, catch a falling knife. At some point, reality gets the last laugh. As they say, don’t gamble with any money you can’t afford to lose.",Climate Change Does Not Mean Job Creation

Of course, anyone who believed Democrats were attempting to preserve “norms” or strengthen institutions, or that they were genuinely upset by the overreaches of Donald Trump rather than frustrated that they weren’t the ones wielding power, was just a sap. In the Maddow interview, Schumer reasons that Trump had used the emergency powers “for a stupid wall, which wasn’t an emergency.” Indeed, I opposed Trump’s funding sections of the border wall. Yet securing the border — Schumer, incidentally, voted in favor of a barrier when it was politically expedient — is a tangible project, with a beginning and end, and a clear purpose. Schumer wants to activate special executive powers to fight a nebulous all-encompassing future “emergency” that entails control of entire sectors of the economy, all the while erasing the legislative choices of states and economic choices of individuals. Practically speaking, the micromanaging of the economy under the diktats of a progressive “climate emergency” would be far closer to the definition of fascism than the ones casually thrown around by contemporary liberals. When Trump was president, The Atlantic summed up the legitimately scary reach of national emergency powers: The premise underlying emergency powers is simple: The government’s ordinary powers might be insufficient in a crisis, and amending the law to provide greater ones might be too slow and cumbersome. Emergency powers are meant to give the government a temporary boost until the emergency passes or there is time to change the law through normal legislative processes. What emergency powers are not meant to do is give the executive branch a permanent boost because it can’t convince enough legislators to adopt its preferred policies. When Trump appropriated funding for his wall, Schumer called it “an outrageous power grab by a president who refuses to accept the constitutional separation of powers,” and argued that the only recourse was “to terminate the emergency declaration and reassert our constitutional authority.” So reassigning federal funding for a border project is an attack on the constitutional separation of powers, but empowering the executive branch to create new policies to stop a slight variation of the Earth’s climate, treated as an existential threat, is not? We’ll deliver The Capital Note to your inbox each weekday. No charge. Schumer’s whataboutism would be more convincing if he, and the Obama administration, hadn’t rationalized a string of executive abuses with similarly rickety reasoning. Obama had habitually ignored the legislative process because, argued Democrats, their colleagues simply refused to do their jobs — by which they meant pass legislation that placated the president. And the more seats Democrats lost, the more executive actions Obama took. So much for our sacred democratic institutions. Joe Biden, perhaps the most pliable politician in American history, may well declare such an emergency. Or try. Presidents Trump, Obama, and George W. Bush signed four executive orders on their first day at work, combined. Biden signed 17. And he kept going. It’s true that tallying up gross numbers of executive orders only tells us so much. But Biden wasn’t dedicating federal buildings; he was signing orders to “preserve and fortify” the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that granted amnesty to millions without any legislation. Even Obama argued that it was only a “temporary stopgap measure.” Biden then rejoined the Paris climate accords, an international agreement that hands the nation’s energy-policy goals to Europe and China without going to the Senate for approval. These actions occasioned no tearing of garments by Schumer or the press about the end of democracy. “Biden’s climate change plan is all about jobs and justice,” explained one Washington Post “analyst.” There is nothing Democrats could do on climate front, no power grab too big, that wouldn’t be cheered on. A “climate emergency” is the culmination of decades of scaremongering. Every year, and with every flood or drought or hurricane or rain shower, the Left ratchets up the doomsday scenarios. Media outlets like CNN propagandize by adopting meaningless and completely unscientific phrases such as “climate crisis.” If there were truly a planet-threatening climate crisis, Democrats would not simply call for the long-term elimination of fossil fuels, but would also embrace a massive nuclear-energy program, as that is the only feasible alternative. The story of mankind is one of acclimatization. We use technological advances and efficiencies to deal with change. It’s one thing to make a market push to adopt other sources of energy. But there is no emergency. By every quantifiable measure of human existence, in fact, we are better off today because of affordable and reliable fossil fuels. We can disagree on this issue. But it’s up to voters, legislatures, and individuals to decide whether they want to dismantle modernity, not Joe Biden. The story of mankind is also replete with stories of those in power using sham emergencies to grab more control over citizens. To some extent, both parties have abdicated their responsibilities, handing power to the executive branch. But Schumer, who not only advocates a “climate emergency” declaration, but is open to destroying the Senate’s counter-majoritarian procedural norms by eliminating the legislative filibuster and corrupting the judiciary with a partisan Court-packing scheme, is a uniquely damaging opponent of the constitutional order.",Chuck Schumer Begs Joe Biden to Take Power from Congress

But one of his first moves was to throw 11,000 mostly union workers out of their jobs building the Keystone XL Pipeline. Environmentalists want the Canada-U.S. crude oil project killed, and Biden did their bidding, even after project managers promised it would be built with net-zero new carbon emissions. Neal Crabtree, a 46-year-old welding foreman and a member of Pipeliners Local Union 798, posted on Facebook that he felt “a sick feeling in my stomach and an aching in my heart” when he heard Biden had canceled Keystone’s permits. “We’ve got guys that haven’t worked in months, and in some cases years, and to have a project of this magnitude canceled, it’s going to hurt a lot of people, a lot of families, a lot of communities,” he told Fox News.

President Biden canceled the construction permit for the pipeline in one of his first executive orders following his inauguration. The pipeline, owned by TC Energy, was intended to transport oil from Canada’s oil sands in Alberta and Saskatchewan to Nebraska, where the oil would be rerouted to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico. Initially rejected by the Obama administration over environmental concerns, the Trump administration approved the project. Scott Moe, the Premier of Saskatchewan, urged the Biden administration to allow construction of the pipeline. Moe’s comments came just before Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were scheduled to speak on Friday, in Biden’s first call to a foreign leader. Trudeau commented that he was “disappointed” in Biden’s decision to cancel construction. According to Moe, the project’s cancelation would lead to the loss of “tens of thousands” of jobs both in Canada and the U.S. We’ll deliver The Capital Note to your inbox each weekday. No charge. “My understanding is there are many union jobs” in the U.S., where a “unionized workforce is currently constructing this very integral piece of infrastructure. So those jobs will be gone, and gone immediately,” Moe said. “And it will provide us much less security in the jobs that are in the Gulf Coast, in the refineries…where this pipeline would ultimately secure those jobs for years to come.” The pipeline was vociferously opposed by environmental groups, who view the Canadian oil sands as a source of “dirty” energy. Various Native American tribes have also opposed construction of the pipeline. However, Moe emphasized that the pipeline itself is unique in that it runs on net-zero carbon emissions, and TC Energy has stated the pipeline will be powered entirely by renewable energy by 2030. Additionally, energy producers in the west side of Saskatchewan have been able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in each barrel of oil that they drill. “In this particular area…the greenhouse gas emissions in each barrel of oil has been reduced by 50 percent,” Moe said. “That is a comparatively sustainable energy that is going into the Keystone XL pipeline, down to the Gulf Coast…ultimately offsetting the need for a much dirtier energy source coming in from Venezuela or one of the OPEC nations.” Ultimately, Moe warned that canceling the pipeline could harm not just Canada’s, but the entire North American energy economy. “We need to remember that we need a regulatory environment—not just in Canada, not just in the U.S., but across our border—to ensure that our integrated economy remains competitive,” Moe said.

408,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/yes-biden-wants-to-end-fracking/,NR,Far Right,"We know Joe Biden wants to end fracking not only because his campaign literature promised to achieve “a 100 percent clean energy economy and net-zero emissions” in a few decades but because he explicitly asserted as much on numerous occasions. When CNN’s Dana Bash asked Biden during a Democratic primary debate: “Would there be any place for fossil fuels including coal and fracking in a Biden administration?” Biden responded, “No, we would we would work it out. We would make sure it’s eliminated.” When Bernie Sanders said, “I’m talking about stopping fracking, as soon as we possibly can,” Biden replied, “No more, no new fracking.” In an exchange in New Hampshire during the primary, a voter asked the then-presidential candidate: “But like, what about, say, stopping fracking?” Biden answered: “Yes.” Yet, when the Trump campaign ran an ad featuring a woman saying, “If Joe Biden’s elected, he’ll end fracking. . . .

We’ll deliver The Capital Note to your inbox each weekday. No charge. Anyway, on his very first day on the job, Biden did what he had promised, using executive power to limit fracking to the best of his ability, stopping construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, establishing a bunch of  new fracking regulations on public lands, and reinstating the pseudoscientific, anti-fracking “Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases.” In a Forbes article, “Did Biden Break Campaign Promise On Fracking? No—And Here’s Why,” Rachel Sandler makes the acutely irrelevant observation that “the president does not even have the power to ban fracking nationally.” Biden, you see, is only banning the fracking he can ban. Which is tantamount to arguing that Donald Trump never supported a wall on the southern border because he didn’t have the power to unilaterally build it. No serious person would buy it. Presidential candidates make promises all the time that can only be achieved through legislative means. Presidents don’t actually “cut taxes” themselves, they need the legislatures to write the bills. We still consider “tax cuts” to be the stated position of Republican candidates. Fact-checkers were right, of course, that Biden wouldn’t end fracking in a single day with a single decree. Because he can’t. Fact-checkers were also right that Biden couldn’t retroactively ban fracking; he could only end “new” fracking. It’s true, as well, that Biden lied about his position, and the unskeptical press filtered his falsehood through their coverage. Even today, the easiest way to clear up Biden’s position would be for a reporter to snap out of their sycophantic trance and ask the president if he would sign an energy bill that included a national fracking ban. I assume he would, as eliminating fossil fuels is the stated policy aim.

Just a couple of months ago, the U.S. formally (and finally) completed the withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement announced by President Trump in 2017. On Wednesday, one of the first actions of the newly inaugurated President Biden was to begin the process for rejoining the Paris accord (it will take 30 days, as opposed to the years required to conclude America’s earlier departure). As when the U.S. initially signed up to the agreement under President Obama, this will be achieved by executive order, another example of the way that climate campaigners can be reluctant to subject their policy prescriptions to regular democratic review. And so, we will, it seems, always have Paris. This is not a good thing. In theory, the agreement imposes little by way of legal obligation, other, mainly, than a duty on the part of its signatories to file periodic reports on their climate progress. But this is designed to underpin a “name and shame” regime, which, in democracies, will be used by activists, regulators, politicians, and (quite possibly) lawyers to force through a domestic climate-change agenda. That could be seen in the U.S. under the Obama administration and has continued to be the case here at the state level. By 2019, 25 states had committed to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions in a manner “consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement.” Meanwhile, much of Europe is engaged in trying to set emissions targets to levels of ever greater impracticality or destructiveness (take your pick). As a reminder that rejoining the Paris agreement is not a move that can be seen in isolation, in the first full day of his administration, President Biden withdrew the permit for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and set the stage for a regulatory onslaught that will rein in the economy, if not the climate. Meanwhile, the leaders of less respectable polities will play along, politely but insincerely, while extracting every conceivable economic and strategic advantage over a West still naïve enough to believe that its display of economic self-harm will set an example that the rest of the world will wish to emulate rather than avoid. Thus China, the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, recently “pledged” that it would aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The Beijing regime has also claimed that China’s greenhouse-gas emissions will peak “around” 2030. Perhaps it is unkind to mention that by the middle of last year, China was approving new coal plants at the fastest rate since 2015. It might be no less charitable to observe that, if the oil price falls as a result of reductions in Western demand driven by climate-change regulation, China, the world’s largest importer of crude oil, will have no complaints.

A number of Republicans have said that the deal results in the U.S. reducing emissions to the benefit of foreign nations. “This agreement will do little to affect the climate and will harm the livelihoods of Americans,” Cruz said on Twitter. “ I’ll continue working with my colleagues to fight for blue-collar workers and to defend America’s energy independence.” Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.), a vocal climate activist, pushed back against Cruz’s comments, joining a chorus of voices online that noted that the name of the agreement comes from the city in which it was signed, rather than the citizens it is meant to help.

However, there are no enforcement mechanisms in place to hold countries accountable. Thus far no signatory has met the required threshold. Some experts have warned the agreement does not go far enough: the United Nations Environment Programme cautioned that the targets set out by the accord would still allow temperatures to increase by 5.7 degrees Fahrenheit by the conclusion of the century.

The Canadian prime minister must have been relieved to be done with President Donald Trump, only to learn that Joe Biden plans to tell Canada to pound sand as one of his first priorities. According to reports, Biden wants to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline immediately, a pointless and economically destructive gesture meant to appease his party’s climate fanatics. The multi-billion-dollar project to run from Alberta to Nebraska was first proposed years ago in the naive faith that two adjoining, friendly countries could cooperate on a big, mutually beneficial infrastructure project. That was before the Keystone XL became a hate totem for the Left, which makes it sound like the pipeline might be the tipping point toward inevitable planetary destruction, among its myriad other alleged sins. President Barack Obama denied a cross-border permit for the project in 2015. President Trump quickly reversed course. And now Biden is likely going to reverse Trump’s reversal. It’s a symptom of our time that a major investment that deserves some stability in American decision-making has become a shuttlecock between outgoing and incoming administrations — and been caught in a nightmarish trap of litigation and red tape all the while. It’s not clear why adding a new pipeline to an existing network built in previous phases of the Keystone project would be thought such a heinous environmental crime (Keystone XL is the fourth phase). Nor why this particular leg of pipeline is considered so threatening in a country that already has a couple of million miles of pipeline. The charge is that Keystone XL, by making it easier for Canada to export its “dirty” oil from the oil sands of Alberta, will herald the beginning of a fossil-fuels apocalypse. We’ll deliver The Capital Note to your inbox each weekday. No charge. But we already consume lots of petroleum from the oil sands. According to the Canadian government, 97 percent of its proven reserves are located in the oil sands, and the oil sands account for more than 60 percent of the country’s current oil production. Canada is the third-largest exporter of crude oil in the world, and 98 percent of that goes to the United States, accounting for almost half of our imports of crude oil. In a more rational time, it was considered a good thing to get oil from a country that isn’t located in the Middle East, isn’t a petro-dictatorship, and isn’t hostile to the United States. Canada also is a responsible, environmentally conscious country unlike, say, Venezuela. It is true that extracting crude from the oil sands is somewhat more energy-intensive than other forms of extraction, but it is foolish to pretend that this extra increment of CO2 is the difference-maker in the future of the planet. Regardless, this energy isn’t simply going to stay in the ground. It will be extracted and sent somewhere by some means. Currently, much of it is being exported to the United States via rail. This is a more energy-intensive mode of transport than pipeline, yet the same people worried about marginal additional CO2 emissions aren’t agitating to get it out of railcars and into pipelines. The enemies of Keystone XL have used litigation to tie up the project, even though it has passed multiple massive regulatory reviews. When it seemed it could finally get underway in earnest, here comes Joe Biden to put the kibosh on it again. This is another sign that Biden’s version of moderation is giving the Left what it wants, only in a piecemeal fashion. He will surely be more polite to Canadian leaders than Trump was, but this is a blow to a Canadian government that thought it could rely on us to act rationally and shows that union workers take a backseat in the Democratic Party to noisy adherents of fashionable causes.

Biden has promised to sabotage the Keystone XL pipeline, a privately financed, multi-billion-dollar project already under way, and “cancel it on his first day,” according to a briefing document cited by the BBC. The Keystone pipeline would, if it were allowed to, carry crude from the oil sands of Alberta to Nebraska, where the pipeline would link up with the existing distribution network to send that oil on to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico. This would benefit Canadian producers and their investors, American refineries and their large, excellently paid work forces — those good, high-paying, blue-collar jobs Biden talks about — and, most important, American consumers, who would have access to yet another source of fuel at attractive prices from a nearby friendly country. This sort of thing is the point of international economic cooperation. The notional case against Keystone is environmental in the main part, and in the lesser part an issue of Indian lands and rights. The environmental case is unsound: Canada has ratified the Paris agreement and takes environmental issues relatively seriously. Innovation and technological improvements have substantially reduced the greenhouse-gas emissions associated with Canadian tar-sands productions — by 30 percent since the 1990s, as the Canadian government calculates. Of course, it matters relatively little whether a gallon of gasoline in the tank of a Cadillac Escalade in Houston is refined from Canadian tar-sands oil or from West Texas oil — the relevant emissions come overwhelmingly from the point of combustion. Of course there are environmental challenges associated with the oil sands, as there are with any usable source of energy, including wind and solar. These are regulatory and practical challenges that are perfectly manageable. (Which is not the same thing as a guarantee that U.S. or Canadian authorities, or businesses, will manage them perfectly — that kind of oversight is hard work and a serious business.) The same is true of “fracking” and other petroleum-extraction practices. There are many reasonable ways to manage tradeoffs between economic development and environmental priorities — if environmentalists were interested in reasonable tradeoffs, which they aren’t. Biden, already looking over his shoulder at a restive progressive caucus, apparently intends to buy environmentalists off with other people’s money. Fossil fuels, far from being the great villain of the climate story, have been the main source of greenhouse-gas reductions in the United States over the past several decades, as relatively clean-burning natural gas displaces relatively dirty coal in electricity generation. But that is not the kind of intelligent tradeoff that interests American environmentalists, who are moralists and romantics and committed to the notion that hydrocarbon fuels are, simply, evil — and that they must be fought on every front. Hence, the American Left’s comprehensive and total war on any and all infrastructure associated with our most abundant energy sources — not only oil pipelines but natural-gas pipelines, too, along with rail-shipping facilities, refineries and other plants, and West Coast export depots intended to help U.S. producers in Asian markets. If it produces, consumes, moves, or processes oil or gas, the American Left opposes it. If Joe Biden is interested in improving the employment and wage outlook for middle-class Americans, he ought not make our industrial, chemical, manufacturing, transportation, and electricity sectors hostage to the narrow-minded concerns of a small group of fanatics. We’ll deliver The Capital Note to your inbox each weekday. No charge. There is a worrying Hayekian lesson in this, too: It is impossible for American businesses to make big, long-term investments in a political environment in which every project is up for renegotiation — or summary economic execution — every time the White House changes hands. Why invest in building and moving physical goods, and taking on the political risk that goes along with such investments, when you could join the booming financial sector and put your money into the money business? This is not to sniff at finance or other work in the service economy, but, surely, in a continental nation as vast as ours, with an economy as complex as ours, it shouldn’t be possible for one man serving a short term in a temporary elected office to undo years of work and billions of dollars in investment. This is pure foolishness, and it will cost us. Joe Biden is getting ready to get off to a poor start. And if he thinks that he can buy off the green lobby by sacrificing Keystone, he is mistaken.

414,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/climate-legislation-by-regulation-now-the-sec/,NR,Far Right,"One of the numerous shared characteristics of “socially responsible” investing and the (closely linked) ideology of “stakeholder capitalism” is the way that both are being used to push through a progressive political and social agenda (particularly when it comes to environmental issues and, more specifically, climate change) without going through the usual democratic process. One way of achieving this is by forcing change through by regulation rather than legislation. I have written about this topic on several occasions, and, in a post yesterday, I linked to an article in Real Clear Energy by Rupert Darwall, in which (specifically) he looked at what has been going on (nothing good) at the CFTC (the Commodity Futures Trading Commission) but in which he also underlined the extent to which regulatory pressure (or the likelihood of regulation to come) could be contributing to a green bubble. Darwall (my emphasis added): The CFTC makes no secret of seeing its job as finding ways to channel capital toward net-zero investments. When financial regulators and central bankers start playing climate politics under the guise of promoting financial stability, they lose focus on their core responsibility. Markets thrive on diverse, often conflicting, views of the future. They over-heat when a single view predominates. Savage corrections can follow . . . . And therein lies the true threat to financial stability. I’ve written a bit myself about what the CFTC is up to here, but I’d recommend Darwall’s demolition of its laughable report, Managing Climate Risk in the U.S. Financial System, both for the brutal fun of it, and as a warning of the way that dubious claims of risk prevention are being (or will be) used by regulators as a means to conscript private corporations into the climate campaign. As Darwall notes, central banks (including, recently, the Fed) are getting in on this act. They too are justifying their behavior on the grounds of risk management, something which, in a talk given, rather bravely, to a conference organized by the European Central Bank (ECB), John Cochrane took apart here. I’ve quoted this extract from Cochrane’s remarks before and, doubtless, will do so again, but: Let me point out the unclothed emperor: climate change does not pose any financial risk at the one-, five-, or even ten-year horizon at which one can conceivably assess the risk to bank assets. Repeating the contrary in speeches does not make it so. Risk means variance, unforeseen events. We know exactly where the climate is going in the next five to ten years. Hurricanes and floods, though influenced by climate change, are well modeled for the next five to ten years. Advanced economies and financial systems are remarkably impervious to weather. Relative market demand for fossil vs. alternative energy is as easy or hard to forecast as anything else in the economy. Exxon bonds are factually safer, financially, than Tesla bonds, and easier to value. The main risk to fossil fuel companies is that regulators will destroy them, as the ECB proposes to do, a risk regulators themselves control. And political risk is a standard part of bond valuation. That banks are risky because of exposure to carbon-emitting companies; that carbon-emitting company debt is financially risky because of unexpected changes in climate, in ways that conventional risk measures do not capture; that banks need to be regulated away from that exposure because of risk to the financial system—all this is nonsense. (And even if it were not nonsense, regulating bank liabilities away from short term debt and towards more equity would be a more effective solution to the financial problem.) As for the idea that this is just about “disclosure,” well, as Cochrane makes clear, the insistence on disclosure is not designed to give investors or regulators information on which they can act, but is rather part of a regime “essentially of shame, boycott, divest, and sanction.” We know where “disclosure” leads. Now all companies that issue debt will be pressured to cut off disparaged investments and make whatever “green” investments the ECB is blessing. And that is why the green bubble, like some bubbles before it, is not entirely irrational, something that makes it all the more dangerous. Meanwhile, this exchange, reported by Darwall, is of interest: Shortly before her nomination as Treasury secretary in the Biden administration, Janet Yellen appeared on a Bloomberg New Economy panel discussing the role of central banks as the world struggles to emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic. The panel revealed a sharp difference of opinion between Yellen and one of her predecessors – Larry Summers, President Clinton’s second Treasury secretary. “Don’t we think that central banks really need to be careful about holding out the idea that they are relevant to sectoral issues involving differentials between one sector or another like environmental protection?” Summers asked. The environment is not within central banks’ “proper remit,” Summers suggested; having the Fed make special efforts to buy green bonds was “a confusion.” “Confusion” is, in this context, a very, very kind word, but Yellen doesn’t appear to have taken the hint: “On sustainable goals, I think it does make sense for supervisors to be taking the risks from both climate-related risks and the risk of changes in prices and stranded assets,” Yellen replied, articulating what has become the consensus among central bankers and financial regulators. The accountancy profession is also, as I noted here, also leaping onto the climate-change bandwagon. But progressive orthodoxy is not confined to climate change. As I discussed here, NASDAQ is pushing to be allowed to set diversity quotas for the boards of companies listed on that exchange, a bizarre move for an institution with the purpose (I always thought) of providing an orderly market for the trading of securities.  And now we come to the SEC. The Wall Street Journal: President-elect Joe Biden is expected to choose Gary Gensler, a former financial regulator and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive, to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to people familiar with the decision. Some of the items on what may, apparently, be on Gensler’s to-do list (whether one agrees with them or not) will doubtless fall within what has conventionally been understood to be the SEC’s remit, but this not so much: Other priorities that a Democratic-led SEC are expected to consider include requiring companies to disclose more information about risks related to climate change and about workforce diversity… “We need a new SEC chair who will put this climate crisis at the top of the agency’s agenda,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) said during a hearing late last year. And if you think that’s good either for shareholders or for economic recovery, well . . .

415,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/green-bubble-inflating/,NR,Far Right,"Writing from the U.K. in an article for CapX, Bill Blain (who “absolutely believe[s] climate change is the biggest challenge humanity faces”), takes a look at wind power and other renewables and is not impressed:  The brutal reality is offshore wind is far less efficient than promised and requires much more expensive maintenance. They break down, sink into their foundations and don’t generate anything like the power expected. For all the due diligence, they simply won’t ever make any money unless the price at which they sell energy is dramatically increased – at which point they make zero sense. This will feel very familiar to many investors who have seen all the blithe assumption about operating and maintenance costs on all kinds of technological green marvels fail to meet expectations. Biowaste generators, biomass, thermal pellets – you name it, and the rosy assumptions failed to materialise because the difficulties in making them work and keeping them working were glossed over by the promoters. Most of the smart money already knew that about renewables and is deeply sceptical. The not-so-smart money still laps the deals up. Sadly, renewables is likely to become another charming but flawed investment thesis… And it’s not just renewables that are attracting big bids because someone else is assumed to have checked that they actually work. There are a host of other green assumptions that are unlikely to stand up to rigorous testing. Whatever you believe about recycling lithium batteries, it’s challenging. They are toxic to mine, toxic to process and toxic to dispose of. As the surveys now show, if you diligently use your electric car for 300,000 miles it will achieve carbon neutrality – as long as you don’t worry about how the electricity is made or how the batteries will be recycled. And yet, what looks ominously like a green bubble continues to inflate. To take just one example, here is Jamie Powell writing for the Financial Times’ Alphaville about the joint venture recently announced between auto manufacturer Renault and Plug Power, a hydrogen and fuel-cell company: The joint venture between [Renault and Plug] will see them work together across three verticals: research and development, manufacturing, and sales. Although, judging by the share price reaction, Renault need the most help with the latter. At pixel time, the French car company’s shares are up 1.5 per cent to €36.80 on the news. That gives it a valuation of just under €11bn. Yet in early trading, Plug Power’s share price is up 17 per cent to $62.36, giving it a market capitalisation of $30bn. Yes, that’s billion with a ‘B’. [earlier Powell had noted that in the third quarter of 2020, the loss-making Plug had reported revenues of just $107 million]. So, in short, the press release caused the market to forecast that the discounted value of Plug Power’s future cash flows from this joint-venture agreement will be worth almost exactly a third of Renault’s market value (which, as a reminder, is the discounted value of its total future cash flows). Okay, yes, we know. The market might be saying: “Well, it’s got this deal in the bag, who’s to say Plug Power can’t secure a few more of them now?” Or perhaps it’s: “This will help the company accelerate its R&D and manufacturing expertise, pulling forward its cash flows by a few years.” But . . . that still doesn’t quite make any sense relative to the extreme price action. In fact, none of this stuff does. Not to bang the drum too hard, but it’s hard not to think this green energy/electric vehicle mania is going to run out of charge. And when it does, no one will be want to left stranded with an empty battery. In late January 2020, Plug was trading at around $4. It closed today at $69.50. This is not to single out Plug, or to comment on its merits as a company or, indeed, its valuation, but it’s hard not see its rise (at least in part) as a symptom of a green bubble that is well underway. We’ll deliver The Capital Note to your inbox each weekday. No charge. So, if you prefer, there’s also this from the Financial Times (and there are many other examples to choose from): Automotive tech start-ups catapulted on to the US stock market via blank cheque vehicles have together amassed a market capitalisation of approaching $60bn even as several are yet to book a single dollar of revenue or make a product. The electric vehicle sector proved fertile hunting ground last year for special purpose acquisition vehicles, which take companies public by raising money from investors and then cutting deals. After stock markets recovered from a March meltdown when the pandemic erupted, blue-chip mutual funds, private equity firms and retail investors ploughed money into Spacs, which often bought companies with grand ambitions but limited track records. With technology disrupting the automotive industry, investors have raced to secure exposure to potential winners — whether battery makers, manufacturers of other forms of power storage or developers of the “lidar” sensors that some believe are key to the development of self-driving cars. Yet according to a Financial Times analysis, the nine auto tech groups that listed via a Spac last year expected revenues of just $139m between them for 2020. They include QuantumScape, a battery company backed by Bill Gates and Volkswagen; the hydrogen truck start-up Nikola; and the lidar company Luminar Technologies. It’s not hard to see what is behind this green bubble. As I noted the other day: Companies now tell anyone who is willing to listen about their plans to operate in a sustainable manner. Others, better still, like to boast of how their products will be assisting in the fight against climate change or otherwise are helping the planet “heal,” a positioning that makes them the darlings of “socially responsible” investors, as well as attractive plays for investors who aren’t too bothered by the environment but like the look of a bandwagon, especially when it is being pushed along by government, regulators, and institutions wanting to green their portfolios. Don’t overlook the extent the role that regulators are playing (or are about to play) in driving a torrent of cash into (at least nominally) green investments. I’ve written before about the mission creep by regulators now determined to do their bit (as they see it) to fight off climate change, often (allegedly) on the grounds of risk control, a distinctly dubious proposition on any reasonably balanced consideration (FWIW, when it comes to climate change, I’m a lukewarmer) of what lies ahead in the next five to ten years. Writing in Real Clear Energy, Rupert Darwall examines in some depth the way that regulators have being using climate risk as a way to expand their mandate, focusing in particular on the CFTC (the Commodity Futures Trading Commission — I wrote about the Commission in this context here), and on the way that it operating in a manner that is — let’s be kind — not altogether trustworthy. The whole article is very well worth reading, but, when thinking about a green stock bubble, I’d flag this (my emphasis added): The CFTC makes no secret of seeing its job as finding ways to channel capital toward net-zero investments. When financial regulators and central bankers start playing climate politics under the guise of promoting financial stability, they lose focus on their core responsibility. Markets thrive on diverse, often conflicting, views of the future. They over-heat when a single view predominates.

The lease offering was a culmination of decades of work, opening to development 1.5 million acres that many considered the biggest single prospect in America. The high expectations fell embarrassingly flat when the bids were opened. Half of the acreage could not even muster a qualifying bid. The bidders who did win are stalking-horse bidders, planning to hold the leases and flip them to a bona fide oil company in the years to come. Those bona fide oil companies — who would eventually drill wells to deliver oil to consumers and royalties to the Treasury — opted to pass and invest elsewhere. The lease sale offered 22 tracts after ten were withdrawn prior to the offering. Of the 22 offered, eleven mustered the minimum bid of $25 per acre, with the highest accepted bid at $33.38 per acre. Put more bluntly, a third of the area was withdrawn, then half of the remaining offering could not muster the minimum bid. The three bidders each managed to take home at least one tract, with one bidder winning nine of eleven tracts. Only two tracts received more than one bid. By any objective standard, this lease sale was a dud. It gets worse. The winning bidder of nine tracts was the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, which is an arm of the Alaska state government. Given that revenues from these tracts are divided evenly between the federal and state governments, it almost seems like a shell game. The nine tracts required a $10 million investment, and the share of revenue to Alaska will be $7.2 million. This lease sale is reminiscent of the debate over below-cost timber sales in the American West a generation ago. Back then, the U.S. Forest Service spent more money demarking timber sales than those tracts of timber brought in revenue. That practice led to an unlikely alliance between fiscal conservatives outraged by the management practice and environmentalists concerned about the impacts of more and more logging. The alliance finally shifted the balance in the Western public-land logging debate. A full accounting of the Alaska Coastal Plain lease sale might give rise to a similar opposition coalition. We’ll deliver The Capital Note to your inbox each weekday. No charge. The Trump administration made a point of resolving a 40-year push to open the coastal plain area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The economic gains of this opening were a feature of the political push. New acreage and drilling on the North Slope would mean high-paying jobs in Alaska, more oil to help operations on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, and a welcome fiscal windfall shared by American and Alaskan taxpayers. As it stands, the federal taxpayer earned $7.2 million. That is a slow start toward the billions over a decade projected by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Why was this lease offering so poorly received? For starters, there is too much oil on the pandemic-ravaged global market. Earlier this week, Saudi Arabia pledged to take 1 million barrels a day off the global market in an effort to convince OPEC members and partners to sustain cuts that could provide higher prices in coming months. This behavior is a clear signal that the value of additional oil on the market today is small, if not negative. As I pointed out previously, this is a bad time to offer oil leases. But there are other factors at play. The expected change in regulatory oversight under the Biden administration likely played a role. So too did the recalcitrance of many banks to underwrite development of leases in this politically sensitive area. Any of the tracts east of Kaktovik are an awfully long way from any market, and the cost of bringing those tracts into commercial production will be especially high. America is literally awash in oil, and finding more in the top-right corner of Alaska is not that high of a priority, especially with strings attached. Three things will happen now. First, the pace of the global recovery from the pandemic will determine the price of oil. The slower the recovery, the lower the price, and the less attractive North Slope development will be. Second, the incoming Biden administration has signaled opposition to any new leases and may make developing these leases more complicated and expensive. How legal challenges to the leases and regulation of development planning unfold could render the leases worthless. Third, the successful bidders will need to figure out how to get a return on their investments, most likely by partnering with oil producers. This is not unusual — less than 10 percent of federal oil and gas leases ever produce. The long-term return to the federal and Alaska Treasuries depends on receiving lucrative royalties, but a willing private partner with capacity to develop the remote leases will need to be rewarded for their efforts.

In order to ensure the right to live for the future generations, there is an imminent need for binding legal measures to be adopted and implemented at the national and international arena against the polluters causing emissions that cause especially climate crisis as well as air, water and soil pollution. Toward that end, the group appears to support laws that would criminalize large-scale enterprises that cause environmental dislocation: WMA proposes the following recommendations to its members and other related organizations: Urge to ask its members to collaborate with relevant bodies in their countries in order to raise awareness about the necessity for legally binding sanctions and policies at the national and international level for the polluters that threaten the right to live for the future generations by emitting gases which are proven to cause climate crisis and air, soil and water pollution. The resolution doesn’t use the word, but this verbiage is implicitly supportive of “ecocide” laws that would criminalize widespread environmental dislocation — including the emission of large amounts of greenhouse gases — as the “fifth crime against peace,” deemed akin to genocide and ethnic cleansing. We’ll deliver The Capital Note to your inbox each weekday. No charge. The resolution then calls for word engineering, and more alarmingly, for governments to declare a “climate emergency”: Urge all medical professionals, media, governmental and non – governmental institutions to refer climate change as ‘climate crisis’ and calls the leaders of national, state or provincial, regional, city, and local governments to declare a climate emergency in order to initiate a society-wide action. Moreover, encourage the media to promote the concept and meaning of the right to live for future generations. Declaring a “climate emergency” would open the door to the same kind of rule by diktat over environmental policy that we see now in the fight against COVID. Imagine Governors Cuomo and Whitmer having the kind of power they now wield in to fight COVID to implement left-wing environmental policies, and you can envision the authoritarian possibilities of such a policy. Medical students are to be mandatorily propagandized in global-warming orthodoxies: Update the curriculum at medical schools and add compulsory sections on environmental health in order to educate health professionals that are able to think critically about the health impacts of the environmental problems, are aware of the reasons, impacts/dimensions of the climate crisis and able to offer solutions designed to protect the rights and health of future generations. Methinks that “critical thinking” would be the last purpose of these mandatory indoctrination classes. The Resolution goes all in to support the usual climate-change policies, such as eliminating industrial-meat-producing and fishing practices, wealth redistribution, and the pipe dream of making it all up by creating “green jobs.” Of course there is no substantive mention of the profound economic contraction such policies would cause. Nor do the enlightened ones mention the adverse health consequences that would result therefrom.",World Medical Association Wants Worldwide ‘Climate Emergency’ Declared
419,https://www.dailywire.com/news/bill-gates-eliminate-all-greenhouse-gas-in-30-years-or-else-world-will-be-5x-worse-than-pandemic,DW,Far Right,"Left-wing billionaire Bill Gates claimed on Sunday during an interview on “Fox News Sunday” that if the world does not completely eliminate greenhouse gases within the next 30 years that people won’t be able to go outside, there will be a massive migration crisis, and things will be five times worse than they were at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. “You say that we have to go from the 51 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions from 51 billion tons to zero – zero by the year 2050, and that anything less than that will precipitate a catastrophe,” Fox News host Chris Wallace said. “Well, yes. The CO2 stays in the atmosphere for thousands of years, and that’s what forces the temperatures to go up. And so, it’s really the sum of all those emissions starting in the industrial age that’s causing this temperature forcing with all of its ill effects,” Gates said. “You know, there’s no magic date that, it’s all great until then, and it’s — it’s terrible once you cross that threshold. It’s pretty linear as far as we know. 2050 happens to be the soonest realistic date for the world to change all of these source emissions — which are actually quite broader than most people are aware of, because it’s got things like steel and cement, not just cars and electricity.” Gates also claimed during the interview that the fact that he lives in mansions and flies around in private jets is not really the issue that critics say it is when they point out his hypocrisy because he is “offsetting” his carbon emissions. “You admit at the very start of your book in the opening pages that you are an imperfect messenger for all this — you admit, you acknowledge you live in big houses, you fly around in private jets and have a big carbon footprint,” Wallace said. “So, how do you answer people who say, well, who’s Bill Gates to preach to us?” “That’s absolutely right, I am offsetting my carbon emissions by buying clean aviation fuel and funding carbon capture and funding low-cost housing projects to use electricity instead of a natural gas,” Gates responded. “And so, I’ve – I have been able to eliminate it, and it was amazing to me how expensive that was. We’ve – that cost of being green, the green premium, we’ve got to drive that down.” When asked what happens “if we don’t make it” to “zero net emissions by 2050,” Gates claimed, “Well, the migration that we saw out of Syria for their civil war, which was somewhat weather dependent, we’re going to have 10 times as much migration because the equatorial areas will become unlivable.” “You won’t be able to farm or go outside during the summer,” Gates claimed. “The wildfires, the – you know, even the farming productivity in the south of the U.S., the droughts will reduce productivity very dramatically. And it’s all a matter of degree. If we wait 10 more years, it’s not as bad as if we wait 20 or you wait 30, because the temperature just keeps going up, and it’s going up more rapidly than it has in natural history. But the instability overall will be five times as many deaths at the peak of the pandemic and going up every year.” WATCH: Billionaire Bill Gates pushes climate hysteria: We eliminate all greenhouse gases in 30 years otherwise you won’t be able to farm or go outside during the summer and “the instability overall will be five times as many deaths at the peak of the pandemic and going up every year.” pic.twitter.com/FBRzRSA5VF — (((Jason Rantz))) on KTTH Radio (@jasonrantz) February 21, 2021  TRANSCRIPT: CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST: Critics say, you know, it’s easy to talk about getting off fossil fuels, it’s easy to talk about going to a plant-based diet, but the reality is that hundreds of thousands of people will lose their jobs — that the coal miners in West Virginia or the livestock ranchers in Nebraska will be wiped out. BILL GATES, CO-FOUNDER, MICROSOFT: Well, it’s very important, as we solve this problem, that we not cause those community dislocations. We have a 30-year transition period. The skill sets involved, whether it’s making clean hydrogen, sequestering CO2, the engineering skill sets, the things that those workers do will be important. In fact, we’re going to have to almost triple the size of the electric grid and build all that transmission. And so, it’s not like there’s going to be a shortage of jobs overall, it’s just balancing to make sure that each community gets into the plan. WALLACE: Let’s talk about your book. You say that we have to go from the 51 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions from 51 billion tons to zero – zero by the year 2050, and that anything less than that will precipitate a catastrophe. GATES: Well, yes. The CO2 stays in the atmosphere for thousands of years, and that’s what forces the temperatures to go up. And so, it’s really the sum of all those emissions starting in the industrial age that’s causing this temperature forcing with all of its ill effects. You know, there’s no magic date that, it’s all great until then, and it’s — it’s terrible once you cross that threshold. It’s pretty linear as far as we know. 2050 happens to be the soonest realistic date for the world to change all of these source emissions — which are actually quite broader than most people are aware of, because it’s got things like steel and cement, not just cars and electricity. WALLACE: I want to pick up on that because you say in your book, don’t fool yourselves, this is going to be hard. And you have a chart that I want to put up in your book of how much greenhouse gas is emitted by what we do. Making things – cement, steel, plastic 31 percent of all emissions, plugging in — electricity 27 percent, growing things 19 percent, getting around — transportation 16 percent, and keeping warm and cool 7 percent. You say a lot of the things that we’re focused on now like electric vehicles are important, but that’s the easy part. GATES: Exactly. If all you had to do was a 30 percent reduction, then you should take the easiest 30 percent. Because the goal is to get to zero, you’ve got to work in parallel, not just on the easy stuff, but also on the very hard stuff. You’ve got to increase R&D budgets. You’ve got to have lots of risk capital to make these products in a new way, and hopefully create companies that not only build jobs but export these green approaches to the entire world. WALLACE: You admit at the very start of your book in the opening pages that you are an imperfect messenger for all this — you admit, you acknowledge you live in big houses, you fly around in private jets and have a big carbon footprint. So, how do you answer people who say, well, who’s Bill Gates to preach to us? GATES: That’s absolutely right, I am offsetting my carbon emissions by buying clean aviation fuel and funding carbon capture and funding low-cost housing projects to use electricity instead of a natural gas. And so, I’ve – I have been able to eliminate it, and it was amazing to me how expensive that was. We’ve – that cost of being green, the green premium, we’ve got to drive that down. But, to me, my experience in innovation and thinking about the right metrics, I felt like, if we have this idealistic generation and this wonderful goal, we need a plan and that my experience could help contribute to that plan. WALLACE: Then there are the critics on the left who say you are behind the curve, and that, in fact, you should be supporting the Green New Deal and going for zero net emissions, not in 2050, but in 2030. GATES: Yeah, it’s completely unrealistic to think we could eliminate emissions by 2030. And not seeing that this problem is hard is – will be part of the difficulty of getting engaged into it, into it. So, where I come out, and I’ll try to have great debates with people, is that it’s very hard. We’re going to have to use all 30 years, but it’s not impossible. WALLACE: And what happens if we don’t make it, if we don’t get to zero net emissions by 2050? What – how will our daily lives be different? GATES: Well, the migration that we saw out of Syria for their civil war, which was somewhat weather dependent, we’re going to have 10 times as much migration because the equatorial areas will become unlivable. You won’t be able to farm or go outside during the summer. The wildfires, the – you know, even the farming productivity in the south of the U.S., the droughts will reduce productivity very dramatically. And it’s all a matter of degree. If we wait 10 more years, it’s not as bad as if we wait 20 or you wait 30, because the temperature just keeps going up, and it’s going up more rapidly than it has in natural history.

420,https://www.dailywire.com/news/3-recent-failures-of-green-energy-policies,DW,Far Right,"Upon taking office in January, many of President Biden’s first executive orders related to climate policy. Whether it was re-joining the Paris Climate Agreement, or canceling the Keystone XL pipeline, the Biden administration has been clear in their desire to expand the United States’ use of ‘Green Energy.’ Though the President has insisted that transitioning to green energy will “create well-paying union jobs,” “build a modern and sustainable infrastructure,” and “deliver an equitable, clean energy future,” Americans were reminded over the past week that the path to green energy is by no means smooth. Here are three examples of ambitious renewable energy policies that failed miserably, destroying jobs and risking lives in the process. Texas Millions were left for days without power, water, and heat following unprecedented winter weather in the Lone Star State — a situation driven by failure within the electric grid, including the malfunction of nearly half of the state’s wind turbines. The Austin American-Statesman reported on Sunday that low temperatures and icy conditions ground Texan windmills to a halt. These windmills “comprise 12,000 megawatts of Texas’ installed wind generation capacity, although those West Texas turbines don’t typically spin to their full generation capacity this time of year.” Over the past five years, Texas has grown increasingly reliant upon wind energy. In 2015, wind represented 11% of the state’s energy portfolio. In 2020, it was 23%. On Monday evening, Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson pointed out the failures of ambitious wind policies during his prime time program. “Running out of energy in Texas is like starving to death at the grocery store,” noted Carlson. “You can only do it on purpose, and Texas did.” “Rather than celebrate and benefit from their state’s vast natural resources, politicians took the fashionable route and became recklessly reliant on so-called alternative energy, meaning windmills,” he added. “The windmills failed like the silly fashion accessories they are, and people in Texas died.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), however, believes that Texas’ green energy policies are not extensive enough. “The infrastructure failures in Texas are quite literally what happens when you *don’t* pursue a Green New Deal,” she tweeted. “Weak on sweeping next-gen public infrastructure investments, little focus on equity so communities are left behind, climate deniers in leadership so they don’t long prep for disaster.” California Thanks to its insistence on employing green energy solutions, blackouts are a relatively common occurrence in the Golden State. In the summer of 2020, California — which boasts an economy nearly as large as Germany’s and is home to America’s largest technology innovators — experienced power outages due to a heatwave that strained the electric grid. As with the situation in Texas, much of the problem in California was attributable to renewable energy. The California Independent System Operator — which runs the state’s grid — decided to turn off power due to a lack of available supply. The problem was worse in the evenings, when the state’s extensive network of solar farms began to shut down. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler used the situation as grounds to criticize Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) after he tried to ban the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035. “Beyond the significant questions of legality and the fact that consumer demand for the type of vehicle you would mandate has never met the aspirations of California’s political leadership, your state is already struggling to maintain reliable electricity for today’s demands,” Wheeler said in a letter to the Democratic governor. “California’s record of rolling blackouts — unprecedented in size and scope — coupled with recent requests to neighboring states for power begs the question of how you expect to run an electric car fleet that will come with significant increases in electricity demand, when you can’t even keep the lights on today.” “While it is tempting for federal or state agencies to regulate with a particular technology in mind, it is far more productive to provide innovators the freedom to develop the technologies of tomorrow,” he added. Australia After it passed an aggressive carbon tax, the Land Down Under experienced economic calamity so severe that it was forced to repeal the tax entirely. The Labor party passed the Clean Energy Act in 2011, implementing a carbon tax at a rate of 23 Australian dollars (AUD) per ton. The rate rose to 24 AUD in the next year, and facilities emitting more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually were subjected to additional regulation. The legislation originally sought to “support the development of an effective global response to climate change” and “put a price on greenhouse gas emissions in a way that encourages investment in clean energy, supports jobs and competitiveness in the economy, and supports Australia’s economic growth while reducing pollution.” However, the policy almost immediately achieved the opposite. One economist found that household electricity prices rose by 15% within the first year of the legislation’s passage. Up to 19% of Australian households’ energy expenses were the direct result of the new act and its accompanying regulations. Unemployment and business closure rates promptly skyrocketed as a consequence. The Australian government had no choice but to repeal the carbon tax in 2014, saving Australian families an average of 550 AUD per year.

421,https://www.dailywire.com/news/beto-orourke-blames-gop-for-texas-natural-disaster-calls-culture-debates-stupid,DW,Far Right,"In an MSNBC interview with Chris Hayes on Tuesday, Beto O’Rourke was critical of Republican politicians in Texas as the winter storm natural disaster continues to deeply harm the southern state. “It’s worse than you are hearing,” he told host Chris Hayes. He described the people he’s been talking to, many of whom do not have power and are “desperate” and “suffering.” He explained how almost every major city in Texas would see sub-zero temperatures on Tuesday night, “and many of them will not have electricity, power, or in many instances, water.” The Hill reported on Wednesday, “Several people have died and tens of thousands have been left in the dark and cold since Sunday evening after a winter storm moved through a large swath of the state earlier this week.” O’Rourke said that “far too many have died already,” adding that he is afraid of what will happen in the next twenty-four hours. “So much of this was avoidable,” O’Rourke said during the appearance. “Going back to the deregulation of our electricity grid here in Texas, which has created an incentive to actually not weatherize or protect against these events.” He claimed that this deregulation has allowed for plants to be shut down, providing opportunities for some to profit off of the increase in energy and electricity prices. He added, “And then you have the cascading consequences of these stupid culture battles that are led by the GOP and our Governor Greg Abbott.” He said that while there are emergencies taking place, the focus has been on efforts like making Texas “a sanctuary state for the NRA,” debates over “bathroom bills,” or Mark Cuban’s decision not to play the national anthem at Dallas Mavericks games. The Daily Wire reported on the Dallas Mavericks story, noting that the attempt to ban the anthem was not successful. In a statement released Wednesday afternoon, NBA Chief Communications Officer Mike Bass said the league will play the anthem before games as they start to welcome back fans. Stadiums and arenas have generally been empty or limited across professional sports due to coronavirus precautions. In 2018, when O’Rourke was running for a senate seat against Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), he commented on the actions of players taking a knee during the national anthem at sports games. The Washington Post reported at the time, Replying to a question about player protests during a recent campaign stop, O’Rourke said that he “can think of nothing more American” than “to peacefully stand up, or take a knee, for your rights.”  On Tuesday, he expressed his disapproval that attention has been on these cultural debates and “other kinds of stupidity.” “The energy capital of North America cannot provide the energy needed to warm and power people’s homes in this great state,” O’Rourke continued. “We are nearing a failed state in Texas. And it has nothing to do with God or natural disasters. It has everything to do with the leadership and those in positions of public trust who have failed us.” O’Rourke went on to describe Governor Abbott’s recent State of the State speech and the five priorities he laid out. He said, “Nowhere mentioned in those top five priorities was Covid, or the vaccination rollout,” or the need for protection against natural disasters. The text of Governor Abbott’s prepared remarks for his 2021 State of the State Address, however, shows that he mentioned “Covid” several times, including the discussion of a nurse who “volunteered to be on the frontline in the hospital’s Covid unit.” The governor also added, “If we are going to fully address COVID-related health issues, we must also focus on the mental health challenges that Texans are facing.” O’Rourke claimed that the Governor’s speech focused on less pressing topics, such as election fraud, which O’Rourke claims is not an issue in Texas. O’Rourke discussed climate change, and “the changing in the frequency and severity of natural disasters,” saying “we know this stuff is coming. What we don’t know is whether our leaders are prepared to make the tough political decisions to prepare us for that.” The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

Gates's response? They'll get over it and accept shifts to renewable energy, even if they have to move away. pic.twitter.com/LtstfmgsmD — Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) February 16, 2021  During the interview with CBS “Evening News” anchor and managing editor Norah O’Donnell, Gates also discussed the role beef plays in the fight against climate change. “A lot of Americans will be eating burgers forever. So we need a way of making that that’s not a lot more expensive and not inferior,” said Gates. “So it’s very similar to the electric car learning curve that a little bit of subsidy, a little bit of consumers driving up the volume because they care about climate, will get us to the point where I believe that green premium will also be zero, that you just won’t be able to tell the difference.” According to CBS News, Gates “has invested in plant-based Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat.” “The effort Gates called ‘bigger than anything humanity has done to date,’” CBS News reported, “involves reducing the 51 billion tons of greenhouse gases produced each year — from producing things such as cement, steel and plastic, making electricity, farming and agriculture, transportation and keeping warm — to zero.” Next, Gates discussed the impact the car industry had on climate change. “The global car industry is now saying that the gasoline engine’s days are numbered,” the Microsoft founder said. “The most important thing is your political voice — convincing people of both parties, figuring out who they might trust to listen on this topic, that’s your biggest role is to get this consensus about the goal and then we can debate the tactics to achieve the goal.” Given that Texas is currently facing widespread power outages due to a winter storm which has heavily impacted the efficacy of wind turbines, Gates doubled down on the importance of these forms of energy production. “We need more sources like offshore wind, which would not shut down at the same time because it’s very far away,” he said. He then continued to argue for a broad infrastructure power network, which would “connect Texas and the rest of the country together with a lot more capacity so that you use that diversity of sources as one of the ways you deal with reliability. For the remainder, you’re either storing it, which isn’t easy, or the nuclear reactors are running 24 hours a day.” Gates’ book, “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need,” is due to be released on February 23. In the book, he compares the physical and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to “what will happen regularly if much more is not done to combat climate change.” The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

423,https://www.dailywire.com/news/bill-gates-rich-countries-should-be-eating-100-synthetic-beef,DW,Far Right,"Billionaire and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has called upon the rich nations of the world to switch over to synthetic beef to better combat climate change. Speaking with MIT Technology Review about his new book “How to Avoid Climate Disaster,” Gates discussed his views on improving the “food sector,” and lamented that the political scene may keep first-world nations from going fully synthetic in the beef department. “Do you think plant-based and lab-grown meats could be the full solution to the protein problem globally, even in poor nations? Or do you think it’s going to be some fraction because of the things you’re talking about, the cultural love of a hamburger and the way livestock is so central to economies around the world?” asked the interviewer. “For Africa and other poor countries, we’ll have to use animal genetics to dramatically raise the amount of beef per emissions for them. Weirdly, the US livestock, because they’re so productive, the emissions per pound of beef are dramatically less than emissions per pound in Africa,” said Gates. “And as part of the [Bill and Melinda Gates] Foundation’s work, we’re taking the benefit of the African livestock, which means they can survive in heat, and crossing in the monstrous productivity both on the meat side and the milk side of the elite US beef lines.” “So no, I don’t think the poorest 80 countries will be eating synthetic meat,” he added. “I do think all rich countries should move to 100% synthetic beef. You can get used to the taste difference, and the claim is they’re going to make it taste even better over time. Eventually, that green premium is modest enough that you can sort of change the [behavior of] people or use regulation to totally shift the demand. So for meat in the middle-income-and-above countries, I do think it’s possible. But it’s one of those ones where, wow, you have to track it every year and see, and the politics [are challenging]. There are all these bills that say it’s got to be called, basically, lab garbage to be sold. They don’t want us to use the beef label.” Earlier in the interview, Bill Gates said that synthetic proteins will be required for beef because cows produce methane, a greenhouse gas. “In terms of livestock, it’s very difficult. There are all the things where they feed them different food, like there’s this one compound that gives you a 20% reduction [in methane emissions]. But sadly, those bacteria [in their digestive system that produce methane] are a necessary part of breaking down the grass. And so I don’t know if there’ll be some natural approach there. I’m afraid the synthetic [protein alternatives like plant-based burgers] will be required for at least the beef thing,” he said. “Now the people like Memphis Meats who do it at a cellular level—I don’t know that that will ever be economical. But Impossible and Beyond have a road map, a quality road map and a cost road map, that makes them totally competitive,” he added. Bill Gates, a multi-billionaire who has largely remained shielded, financially, from the economic fallout of the COVID lockdowns, previously endorsed governments shutting down small businesses to combat the virus.

424,https://www.dailywire.com/news/united-airlines-announces-1-billion-deal-to-buy-flying-taxis-for-airport-shuttles,DW,Far Right,"On Wednesday, United Airlines announced plans to purchase up to 200 flying taxis from Archer — an electric aircraft startup based in Palo Alto California — a deal estimated to be worth $1 billion. The Wall Street Journal reported that the “tentative agreement is a stamp of approval for Archer, which said Wednesday that it will go public through a combination with a special-purpose acquisition company in a deal that values the combined company at about $3.8 billion.” United Airlines is partnering with regional carrier Mesa Air Group and plan to use the flying taxis to “whisk passengers over congested highways to hub airports.” The purchase comes as “the airline industry seeks new technologies to reduce its carbon footprint.” According to Archer, the taxis “will be capable of flying 60 miles at 150 miles an hour,” with United claiming that their use “could nearly halve carbon dioxide emissions for passengers traveling from Hollywood to Los Angeles International Airport.” According to Fortune, “Archer has lined up some big-name backers that are putting money into the new public company,” including Stellantis (which owns Fiat Chrysler), the venture arm of Exor (the Agnelli family’s holding company), Mubadala Capital, the Emirati sovereign wealth fund, Putnam Investments, and Federated Hermes Kaufmann Funds. “Collectively,” the Fortune report says, “those investors are putting $600 million into the new company.” In addition, “billionaire financier Ken Moelis and Jet.com founder and former Walmart e-commerce executive Marc Lore” are investing $30 million. The BBC reported that Archer’s flying taxis “will need regulatory approval before the purchase can go ahead,” with United Airlines and Mesa Air Group having the “option to buy another $500m worth of aircraft under the deal.” “With the right technology, we can curb the impact aircraft have on the planet, but we have to identify the next generation of companies who will make this a reality early and find ways to help them get off the ground,” United Airlines chief executive Scott Kirby said in a statement. The Associated Press also reported that “[in] December, United pledged to offset all its carbon emissions by 2050 in part by investing in technology to remove carbon from the air and bury it.” The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

425,https://www.dailywire.com/news/idaho-congressman-looks-to-spend-33-billion-to-remove-dams-to-save-salmon-population,DW,Far Right,"Hoping to address “the decades-long problem of how to save salmon populations without upending a system that provides power to millions of people,” Republican Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson has “proposed removing four hydroelectric dams in the Pacific Northwest.” Rep. Simpson, a U.S. Representative for Idaho’s 2nd congressional district since 1999, unveiled the proposal to breach four dams on the Lower Snake River by the end of next decade. The proposal is estimated to cost $33.5 billion, while relying on approximately $33 billion in a “jobs-and-infrastructure stimulus package expected from the Biden administration this year.” By breaching the dams, the goal is to free up “the waterway for long-ranging salmon that are also a key food source for orcas,” with the plan “finding ways to replace the dams’ key roles in energy, agriculture and transportation.” Known as “The Northwest in Transition,” the plan’s most immediate actions includes removing the Lower Granite Dam, the Little Goose Dam, the Lower Monumental Dam, and the Ice Harbor Dam. “Removing the dams could create economic and logistical problems for farmers and ranchers along the Lower Snake River who rely on the dams for transportation of crops, irrigation and electricity,” reported Chase Biefeldt for The Associated Press (KTVB). “On the other hand, there are many conservation organizations in full support of Simpson’s proposal, like Idaho Rivers United.” According to Simpson, if the dams are not removed, the Idaho salmon population would be condemned to extinction. $16 billion of the proposed funding would be allocated to “replace the dams with other clean energy sources that are friendlier to migrating salmon,” with possible alternatives including “renewable to battery energy, pump storage, and hydrogen storage.” “Congressman Simpson’s proposal to end salmon litigation by breaching the four Lower Snake River Dams does little to restore abundant fish runs,” said David Doeringsfeld, general manager at the Port of Lewiston, the furthest inland seaport on the West Coast. “His proposal throws billions of tax-payer dollars at unproven ideas and provides no explanation on how his ideas would be implemented… The Port is in discussion with the Congressman on his proposal.” In addition to saving the salmon population — with the number of Idaho’s salmon runs having decreased from the millions to just a few thousand — Rep. Simpson has said “he’s hoping the plan starts a conversation that also includes tourism and a major role for Native American tribes.” On Friday, all four Democratic senators from Washington and Oregon issued a joint release, stating: “All communities in the Columbia River Basin and beyond should be heard in efforts to recover the Northwest’s iconic salmon runs while ensuring economic vitality of the region.

426,https://www.dailywire.com/news/as-prices-surge-bitcoin-now-reportedly-consumes-more-electricity-than-argentina-netherlands-and-uae,DW,Far Right,"According to researchers at Cambridge University, in terms of annual energy consumption, Bitcoin now consumes more power than Argentina, the Netherlands, and the United Arab Emirates, at 121.36 TWh. The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, a tool developed by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance under the University of Cambridge’s Judge Business School, provides a real-time update on Bitcoin’s network power. Their annualized chart shows a sudden rise from an estimated annual consumption of 56.48 TWh in late October to almost double that at 112.23 TWH in mid-January. This surge in electricity consumption aligns with the meteoric rise of Bitcoin’s price, which has increased from $13,748 on November 1 to $46,517.40 on February 9. While much focus has been given to its price, experts are reportedly becoming increasingly alarmed by the “sheer level of energy required by so-called miners, which release new coins into circulation.” According to Digiconomist’s Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, a tool created by data scientist Alex de Vries, Bitcoin now has a “carbon footprint comparable to that of New Zealand,” producing an estimated 36.95 megatons of C02 per year. Michel Rauchs, a Cambridge researcher, told CNBC that Bitcoin’s energy needs are “enormously large,” and that Bitcoin accounts “for around 0.5% of total global electricity consumption.” The reason for Bitcoin’s growing consumption of energy is its reliance on a process called “mining,” where “purpose-built computers” compete to solve complex hashing algorithms on which the cryptocurrency’s blockchain — “a digital ledger of all bitcoin transactions” — relies. After Tesla, Inc. announced that they had purchased approximately $1.5 billion Bitcoin and were planning to accept it as payment in the future, Bitcoin’s value hit a record high of $48,000 this week, further fueling the “incentive to Bitcoin miners to run more and more machines.” Critics have pointed out that Tesla’s investment “clashes with the electric car firm’s previous environmental stance” when considering Bitcoin’s energy implications. “Elon Musk has thrown away a lot of Tesla’s good work promoting energy transition,” David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain said, reported by the BBC. “This is very bad… I don’t know how he can walk this back effectively. Tesla got $1.5 billion in environmental subsidies in 2020, funded by the taxpayer. It turned around and spent $1.5 billion on Bitcoin, which is mostly mined with electricity from coal. Their subsidy needs to be examined.” Gerard then proceeded to suggest that a “carbon tax on cryptocurrencies could be introduced to balance out some of the negative consumption.” The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

427,https://www.dailywire.com/news/more-than-100-republicans-to-biden-reverse-devastating-climate-executive-order,DW,Far Right,"More than 100 members of Congress sent a letter to President Joe Biden on Tuesday asking him to reverse his executive order on climate change, calling it “ill-conceived” and “devastat[ing]” to large parts of the economy. Not only did the order include the United States’ re-entry into the Paris Agreement, but it also addressed domestic efforts to reduce the effects of climate change. Included in the group of 105 members who signed the letter were Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), Conference Chair Liz Cheney (R-WY) and House Committee on Natural Resources Ranking Member Bruce Westerman (R-AR). Their response argues that Biden’s environmental strategy will damage the American economy further, noting how millions of Americans are already unemployed because of the harmful effects of COVID-19 on the workforce. The letter also details how Biden’s plan will “handicap” environmental restoration programs by cutting off one of their main sources of funding for conservation: “revenues from conventional energy production.” Biden’s plan places “an indefinite moratorium on new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands and water,” which Republicans explain includes energy and mineral development, both of which are “the largest source of revenues to the federal government after taxes.” The letter adds that a large portion of the money that the federal government receives on these areas comes from “bonus bids from lease sales.” They claim that halting the ability to create new leases will increase the country’s debt and “create an opportunity cost in the billions.” The executive order also “commits to the goal of conserving at least 30 percent of our lands and oceans by 2030.” The Republicans address this, as well, calling the percentage an “arbitrary 30% threshold” and describing this act as a “pledge to lock up” a portion of the United States’ land and water. They describe how “conserving our beautiful public lands and waters is a goal we all share,”  but include that the “rich resources” of the country can be used in “safe, ecologically conscious ways.” They argue that limiting U.S. energy production as Biden proposes “will all but ensure that U.S. demand instead be met by oil and gas from countries with lesser environmental standards,” arguing that the pollution caused by this process will increase. The letter concludes by saying that “energy production and environmental protections are not mutually exclusive” and calls on Biden to work with Republicans on new policy. Shortly after the executive order was signed in January, Roll Call reported that Republicans will likely use Biden’s actions on climate change to win seats in the 2022 midterm elections. The National Republican Congressional Committee spread a memo first obtained by CQ Roll Call that referred to polling from the 2020 election in which voters in “battleground” districts suggested they would be “less likely to support Democrats after hearing that they ‘supported the Green New Deal,’ ‘had repeatedly voted against the oil and gas industry’ or ‘voted to allow future presidents to ban fracking.’” A full list of signatories on the Republicans’ letter to Biden can be found here.

428,https://www.dailywire.com/news/four-dangerous-new-democrat-bills-that-you-probably-havent-heard-of,DW,Far Right,"Following the 2020 election, Democrats control both chambers of the United States Congress. While Republicans narrowed the Democrat majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats managed to assume control of the Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris holding the tie-breaking vote. For the foreseeable future, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) will determine the direction of the most powerful legislative body in the country. As a result, Democratic politicians floated countless aggressive policy proposals — including statehood for Puerto Rico, Washington, DC, and other territories; trillions in spending on COVID-19 relief; and the federal codification of Roe v. Wade — during the latest election cycle. In addition to these high-profile proposals, members of the 117th Congress are now pushing these four new impactful bills and resolutions which, if passed, could alter the political landscape for generations. Creating a Federal Firearms Registry Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) introduced the Sabika Sheikh Firearm Licensing and Registration Act, which would direct the Attorney General to use the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to license and register “each firearm present in the United States.” Under the legislation, all firearm owners would be forced to provide “the make, model, and serial number of the firearm, the identity of the owner of the firearm, the date the firearm was acquired by the owner, and where the firearm is or will be stored” to the ATF. The agency would then create a database made available to the public, as well as all federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. All firearm owners would also have to pay the Department of Justice an $800 fee in exchange for a mandatory gun “insurance policy.” Those who do not comply with the policy may face fines of up to $150,000 and prison sentences of up to 25 years. In a separate bill, Rep. Lee also proposed the hiring of 200 additional ATF agents — an 8% increase in the department’s current force. Canceling $50,000 in student debt Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) proposed a resolution that would encourage President Biden to unilaterally cancel federal student loans. Through the resolution, the two “squad” members ask President Biden to use “executive authority” and erase up to $50,000 in debt for each federal borrower. The text of the resolution states that over 43 million borrowers currently hold over $1.5 trillion in federal student loans. It also states that black students have been “forced” to accrue more student debt than white students due to “ongoing structural barriers that have resulted in persistent racial inequities in incomes and wealth.” “The student debt crisis is a racial and economic justice issue,” said Rep. Pressley in a statement. “President Biden has the legal authority to cancel billions in student debt with the stroke of a pen and he must meet the moment by using that authority, which would not only set us on a path to an equitable recovery, but would also help reduce the racial wealth gap.” “Millions of Americans can’t afford to put food on the table and feed their families,” said Rep. Omar. “The last thing people should be worried about right now is their student loan debt.” Other prominent Democrats joined the legislators — including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and former presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Perpetually declaring a climate change emergency Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-NY) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) introduced the FEMA Climate Change Preparedness Act — a bill that would instruct federal agencies to treat climate change as a national emergency. Citing the wildfires that recently ravaged much of the West Coast, Rep. Clarke wants the Federal Emergency Management Agency to place the “climate crisis” at the center of its mandate. “Like so many Americans, I watched in horror last year as wildfires and storms ravaged our nation. Climate change is a crisis,” said Rep. Clarke in a press release. “Our duty in Congress is to take bold action to tackle climate-warming emissions and protect the American public from future climate impacts.” Rep. Clarke believes that her legislation “will ensure that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is fully equipped to help our communities prepare for and recover from the natural disaster implications of climate change.” “All relevant agency policies, plans, programs, strategies, and operations must incorporate and center climate change, and this legislation will ensure that our national lifeline against natural disasters stays in top condition,” said Sen. Markey. In addition to creating a FEMA “Climate Change Subcommittee,” the act would compel FEMA to “recognize climate change as a significant near and long-term threat to homeland security.” FEMA exists to lead the nation’s responses to emergency events such as hurricanes, wildfires, and pandemics. The agency’s budget ballooned from $6.7 billion to $19.4 billion in the last fiscal year alone. Giving bureaucrats control of college sports Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) introduced the “College Athletes Bill of Rights” to grant the federal government sweeping oversight powers over college athletics. “I know firsthand that college sports can open doors of opportunity that most young people never knew existed — but the unfortunate reality is that the NCAA is also exploiting college athletes for financial gain, and disproportionately exploiting Black athletes who are over-represented in the revenue generating sports,” remarked Sen. Booker in a statement. “College athletes deserve better, they deserve justice, and they deserve to share in what they help create.” The legislation would grant student-athletes the ability to market their name, image, and likeness with minimal restrictions. Universities would share up to 50% of profits from their collegiate athletics programs with student-athletes. The bill would also give the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the CDC enforcement power over health standards on a wide variety of injuries, including sexual assault, interpersonal violence, and concussions. Citing low four-year graduation rates among college athletes, the legislation additionally forces universities to provide scholarships to struggling students “for as many years as it takes for them to receive an undergraduate degree.” Perhaps the most sweeping portion of the bill is the creation of a federal “Commission on College Athletics.” The commission would consist of nine members appointed by the President of the United States. These individuals would receive $100 million taxpayer dollars over two fiscal years to enforce the provisions of the College Athletes Bill of Rights. The group would have unilateral power to impose penalties — including suspension for individual students or entire programs.

429,https://www.dailywire.com/news/france-isnt-meeting-its-own-paris-climate-accord-commitments,DW,Far Right,"A court in France found the country guilty of failing to meet its commitments as outlined in the Paris climate accord. CBS News reported that the Administrative Tribunal in Paris ruled last week that France had failed to meet its commitments outlined in the accord, which required the country to reduce greenhouse gases. Four environmental groups filed a lawsuit against the government alleging the country was damaging the environment by not meeting its promises. “While the court declared the government guilty of inaction, it rejected a claim for damages by the four NGOs that brought the suit, ordering the government to pay just one symbolic euro to them instead. The tribunal also said it would decide within two months whether to recommend any measures for the government to resolve its failure to meet its own commitments,” CBS reported. The Paris climate accord was signed in December 2015 and named after France’s capital city, where the signing occurred. At the time, 196 countries agreed to reduce global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius as compared to 1990 levels, CBS reported. France promised to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40% of those levels by 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. In 2020, however, France said it was deferring that commitment, which prompted the four environmental groups to file the lawsuit. Cecile Duflot, the former Green Party leader and cabinet minister who now leads Oxfam France, one of the environmental groups that sued, called the ruling “a historic victory for climate justice.” Jean-Francois Julliard, the director of Greenpeace France, which also contributed to the lawsuit, called the ruling “a political victory.” “Wednesday’s ruling was a blow for French president Emmanuel Macron, who’s made combatting climate change a priority for his administration. It was also a pointed slap in the face for the country that oversaw the negotiations and signing of the Paris Agreement,” CBS reported. “The French government issued a statement saying it had ‘taken note of’ the court’s decision, acknowledging that initial objectives had not been achieved and promising that a new bill to address the climate would be debated in parliament next month. That legislation, the government said, would constitute ‘a new and decisive step in accelerating France’s ecological transition.’” In 2019, then-President Donald Trump officially pulled the United States out of the Paris climate deal, with then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo citing the “unfair economic burden imposed on American workers, businesses and taxpayers” the deal imposed. On his first day in office, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to force the U.S. to rejoin the Paris accord, The Daily Wire’s Ryan Saavedra reported. In 2017, Trump informally removed the U.S. from the Paris accord, even though the agreement said countries couldn’t withdraw for the first three years. Even after Trump symbolically withdrew the U.S., America led the world in decreasing carbon emissions, The Daily Wire’s Emily Zanotti reported. “Strangely enough, Canada, Spain, the European Union, and China — all signatories to the infamous Paris Climate Accords negotiated by the United Nations — saw significant increases in carbon dioxide emissions. China released 120 million more tons of carbon dioxide into the air in 2017 than in 2016. The EU made up for America’s decline, releasing 40 million more tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,” Zanotti reported.

430,https://www.dailywire.com/news/massachusetts-climate-official-on-people-producing-emissions-we-have-to-break-your-will,DW,Far Right,"A Massachusetts climate official made startling remarks regarding people who heat their homes and drive cars, suggesting their “will” needed to be broken in order to reduce carbon emissions. David Ismay, Massachusetts Undersecretary for Climate Change, made the remarks last month during a meeting with the Vermont Climate Council. Ismay said during the meeting that the Bay State had no more “bad guys” left, apparently referring to corporations and that the majority of the emissions that still had to be reduced, in his eyes, were from regular people. “I know one thing that we found in our analysis is that 60% of our emissions come from – as I have it started to say you and me, except you guys are in Vermont – 60% of our emissions come from residential heating and passenger vehicles. Let me say that again: 60% of our emissions that need to be reduced come from you, the person on your street, the senior on fixed-income. Right now there is no bad guy left, at least in Massachusetts, to point the finger at and turn the screws on and now break their will so they stop emitting. That’s you. We have to break your will,” Ismay said, according to a clip posted by the Boston Herald. Ismay went on to say that ““We can’t have no offshore wind, no transmission, no solar, and have clean energy,” adding, “Something has to give. There has to be some mechanism we trust to find a place to site a transmission line.” Ismay admits at the end of the clip, “I can’t even say that publicly.” Gov. Charlie Baker (R-MA), criticized Ismay’s statements, saying it was something “no one who works in our administration should ever say or think,” according to Mass Live. “First of all, no one who works in our administration should ever say or think anything like that,” Baker said. “Secondly, Secretary Theoharides is going to have a conversation with him about that. And third, one of the main reasons we didn’t sign the climate bill when it got to our desk was because we were specifically concerned about the impact it was going to have on people’s ability to pay for many of the pieces that were in it, which means it also doesn’t represent administration policy or position.” The clip was posted by the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, who cut the video clip mid-sentence when Ismay says he can’t publicly say what he had just said. MFA issued its own criticism of Ismay’s comments. “It’s frightening to think an official so high up in the Baker administration is bragging to an out-of-state group about the economic pain he wants to inflict on the very people who he’s supposed to work for,” Paul Craney, a spokesman MFA, told Commonwealth Magazine. “Remarks like this have no place in state government. Ismay should be dismissed from his position in state government, as he’s clearly demonstrated he does not have the best interests of the residents of Massachusetts at heart.” The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

John Kennedy (R-LA) slammed President Joe Biden’s left-wing climate agenda during an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, saying that Biden’s plan will harm the country and families. Kennedy, who made the remarks during an interview with Fox News host Trey Gowdy, also said that Biden was caving to the far-left wing of the Democratic Party when it came to issues related to immigration and predicted that it would backfire. “Well, let me say a word about President Biden’s executive orders on oil and gas,” Kennedy later added. “They are in measurably foolish, they’re going to gut Louisiana like a fish. One third of my state’s GDP is related to oil and gas. And our state is not alone. His war on oil and gas is going to hurt America. It’s going to destroy our energy independence. Here’s President Biden’s New Energy Policy. We’re not going to produce our own oil. Instead, we’re going to buy oil from countries that hate us. So they’ll have more money to buy weapons to try to kill us. It’s in measurably foolish.” “Most Americans support an all of the above energy policy, oil, gas, wind, solar, nuclear, geothermal, hydrogen,” he continued. “But they also understand that we can’t run the greatest economy in all of human history without oil and gas, not now and not probably for a long time. I don’t know about you, Trey, but my car doesn’t run off fairy dust. My car doesn’t run off unicorn urine.

What do we do about it? And they turned it into a religion. And President Biden appears to be sucking it up like a Hoover Deluxe.” Kennedy later noted the difficulties that Americans will face who work in the oil and gas industry, saying, that Biden administration officials were “living in la la land.” “I mean, you’re gonna tell a 50 year old woman who’s been working for an oil and gas company who’s developed extraordinary expertise, who has kids in school, who’s got a mortgage to pay, just to quit your job, because we’re gonna fire you anyway, and go back to school and then you can go work in a green job, but we haven’t told you which one yet?” Kennedy said. “I mean, you know, put down the ball.

We’ve been grappling with it for 35 years. You’re a smart man. What’s the answer? JOHN KENNEDY, SENATOR FROM LOUISIANA (R): Trey, I don’t understand why the issues is perceived to be so complicated. To me, it’s pretty simple. Americans overwhelmingly support legal immigration. That’s why our country invites over a million of our world’s neighbors every year to become American citizens. That’s more than any other country on the planet. I’m flattered that people want to come to America. Other than North Korea, and North Koreans When’s the last time you heard of somebody trying to sneak into China? They want to come here. But unless you have the IQ of a swath, you know the difference between legal and illegal immigration. Illegal immigration is illegal. Duh. Vetting people at the border as every country does, is not racist. It’s prudent. It’s how we enforce our immigration laws. I looked at President Biden’s executive orders. I support his efforts to try to reunite kids with their parents. I mean, who wouldn’t? But the rest of his executive orders don’t seem to make a distinction between the legal and illegal immigration. His executive orders are designed to roll back the efforts of the Trump administration, which did more four years to stop illegal, not legal, but illegal immigration than any other president in my lifetime. And I think, I hate to say this, but I think President Biden has decided to adhere to the to the to the edicts of Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez who worships at the altar of open borders. And I think it’s a big mistake and I don’t think the American people will support it. GOWDY: Senator, you represent a state that is a tremendous energy producer, and you have neighbor states that are also. What do you make of the climate change agenda of this new administration? And what impact is it going to have on workers in your state and throughout the country? KENNEDY: Well, let me say a word about President Biden’s executive orders on oil and gas. They are in measurably foolish, they’re going to gut Louisiana like a fish. One third of my state’s GDP is related to oil and gas. And our state is not alone. His war on oil and gas is going to hurt America. It’s going to destroy our energy independence. Here’s President Biden’s New Energy Policy. We’re not going to produce our own oil.

What do we do about it? And they turned it into a religion. And President Biden appears to be sucking it up like a Hoover Deluxe. GOWDY: Yeah, and former Senator Kennedy, former Senator Kerry rather said that they should go by they should go build solar panels, which I’m all for people building solar panels, but I don’t think that helps the state of Louisiana or Texas right now. KENNEDY: Well, no disrespect to Secretary Kerry, but he’s living in la la Land you need.

432,https://www.dailywire.com/news/climate-czar-john-kerry-on-private-jet-travel-its-the-only-choice-for-somebody-like-me,DW,Far Right,"John Kerry, the U.S. special presidential envoy for climate, once said that a private jet is the “only choice for someone like me” while traveling to accept an award for his climate activism. Kerry took a private jet to Iceland in 2019 to receive the Arctic Circle award for his work on climate change. While his mode of transportation created a buzz in Iceland, Kerry has avoided scrutiny for his choice in the United States until Fox News reported his justifications to Icelandic reporters. Reporter Jóhann Bjarni Kolbeinsson was one of the first to confront Kerry over his choice of travel, saying, “I understand that you came here with a private jet. Is that an environmental way to travel?” Kerry said it was his “only choice” and touted his record on climate activism to justify his high-emissions mode of travel. “If you offset your carbon – it’s the only choice for somebody like me who is traveling the world to win this battle,” Kerry said. “I negotiated the Paris Accords for the United States,” he added. The Paris Climate Accords is a symbolic multilateral agreement to cut emissions negotiated under former President Barack Obama, abandoned by former President Donald Trump, and will likely be rejoined by the United States under President Joe Biden. “I’ve been involved with this fight for years. I negotiated with [Chinese] President Xi to bring President Xi to the table so we could get Paris,” Kerry said, referring to the Accords. “And, I believe, the time it takes me to get somewhere, I can’t sail across the ocean. I have to fly, meet with people and get things done.” He did not give a reason why he chose to fly private rather than commercial. Per passenger, private jets produce an estimated 40 times more carbon than commercial flights. “But, what I’m doing, almost full time, is working to win the battle on climate change, and in the end, if I offset and contribute my life to do this, I’m not going to be put on the defensive,” Kerry said. Last week, U.S. climate czar Kerry’s family was revealed to own a private jet despite Kerry’s commitment to combating climate change. Federal Aviation Administration records show a Gulfstream Aerospace jet owned by Kerry’s wife’s private charter jet company. The jet’s registration expires in October 2023. Also last week, Kerry was slammed for telling fossil fuel workers who may lose their jobs because of the Biden administration’s policies on climate change that they can find alternate work in the clean energy industry. “You know, you look at the consequences of black lung for a miner, for instance, and measure that against the fastest-growing job in the United States before COVID was solar power technician. The same people can do those jobs, but the choice of doing the solar power one now is a better choice. Similarly, you have the second fastest-growing job pre-COVID was wind turbine technician,” Kerry said. “So what President Biden wants to do is make sure those folks have better choices, that they have alternatives, that they can be the people that go to work to make the solar panels, that we’re making them here at home.” The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

433,https://www.dailywire.com/news/bidens-climate-agenda-wont-replace-jobs-it-seeks-to-kill-separate-ap-wapo-fact-checks-suggest,DW,Far Right,"The Associated Press and The Washington Post fact-checked a pair of claims last week that the Biden administration has used, misleadingly, to sell its climate change agenda to the American public. On Wednesday, President Joe Biden claimed that an overhaul of transportation infrastructure to support a new fleet of electric vehicles would create “1 million new jobs in the American automobile industry.” Biden said his administration could accomplish the feat by committing to replace the federal government’s fleet of 650,000 cars with electric models and creating incentives and regulations to transition U.S. transportation infrastructure to support electric vehicles. The Associated Press fact-checked the president’s claim on Thursday, describing the odds of Biden’s plan resulting in 1 million new jobs as “far from certain, if not unlikely.” Many experts as well as the United Auto Workers have said Biden’s plan will result in a net loss of jobs in the transportation sector. The AP reports: There’s plenty of skepticism about this claim. At least some of those new auto-related jobs would come at the expense of current ones. Auto industry analysts don’t see how a net gain of 1 million jobs in that sector can come from Biden’s plan. One million new jobs in the auto industry is a highly ambitious goal that would mean more than doubling the number of workers now employed in motor vehicle and parts manufacturing. Many analysts and the United Auto Workers union, in fact, have warned that electric vehicle manufacturing probably will mean fewer net auto-making jobs. Since taking office, Biden has taken a number of executive actions cracking down on fossil fuel development and production. On Wednesday, John Kerry, the president’s special envoy for climate, said that jobs lost in the fossil fuel industry would be replaced by other jobs in the green energy sector, such as solar power technicians. “You know, you look at the consequences of black lung for a miner, for instance, and measure that against the fastest growing job in the United States before COVID was solar power technician,” Kerry said. “The same people can do those jobs, but the choice of doing the solar power one now is a better choice. Similarly, you have the second fastest growing job pre-COVID was wind turbine technician.” The Washington Post issued two Pinocchios to Kerry for his claim. He botched the claim that solar panel and wind turbine technicians were the first- and second-fastest growing jobs during the pandemic, respectively. Citing Bureau of Labor Statistics data, the Post found that “[w]ind is before solar, not vice versa, and those professions are projected to be the first- and third-fastest-growing jobs, not first and second.” Disregarding that error, however, the Post said Kerry earned his two-Pinocchio rating for the claim that jobs in solar and wind could replace the losses to the coal industry. The Post did not attempt to account for job losses in the oil and gas sector from Biden’s executive actions. The Post reported: For the purposes of this fact check, we’re more interested in how many jobs are represented by those percentages. After all, at the White House, Kerry mentioned these statistics in the context of coal mining jobs — “The same people can do those jobs” — which before the pandemic amounted to about 50,000 jobs (and about 30,000 below surface). Could these solar and wind jobs match that number? In sum, no. Wind turbine jobs are projected to go up by 4,300, from 7,000 to 11,300 in 10 years. The solar installer jobs are projected to go up 6,100, from 12,000 to 18,100. That’s a total increase of just 10,400 jobs — leaving 20,000 coal workers still toiling in the mines.

Married to an heir of the Heinz ketchup fortune, estimates of the couple’s net worth range from around $165 million to as high as $3.2 billion, according to a report in the Los Angeles Times. Despite being super rich and 77 years old, Kerry, who served as secretary of state under former President Barack Obama, jumped back into the spotlight to serve as the U.S. special presidential envoy for climate in the Biden administration. On Wednesday, Kerry appeared in the White House briefing room to talk about President Joe Biden’s expansive climate change policy. During his first days in office, Biden signed executive orders killing an extension of the Keystone XL pipeline, which carries Canadian crude oil into the U.S., and ordering a temporary ban on oil drilling on federal lands. Economists estimate the loss of Keystone will cost 11,000 jobs, and it’s unknowable how many people will be put out of work by the 60-day ban. But Kerry has an idea for all those displaced workers: Make solar panels. In the briefing, a reporter asked Kerry: “Mr. Secretary, if you would, there’s — there certainly are oil and gas industry workers who are watching you both right now who will hear the message that’s — that the takeaway to them is that they are seeing an end to their livelihoods. What do you say to them, particularly those people who President Trump struck a chord with on the campaign trail when he promised to save their jobs?  What is your message to them right now?” “With respect to those workers, no — no two people are more — in this room, are more concerned about it.  And the President of the United States has expressed, in every comment he has made about climate, the need to grow the new jobs that pay better, that are cleaner, that —” Kerry said, breaking off on a tangent about black lung disease for coal miners. “I mean, you know, you look at the consequences of black lung for a miner, for instance, and measure that against the fastest-growing job in the United States before COVID was solar power technician.  The same people can do those jobs, but the choice of doing the solar power one now is a better choice.  And similarly, you have the second-fastest-growing job pre-COVID was wind turbine technician,” he said. “So what President Biden wants to do is make sure those folks have better choices, that they have alternatives, that they can be the people who go to work to make the solar panels — that we’re making them here at home.  That is going to be a particular focus of the Build Back Better agenda.” Kerry also said fossil fuel workers “have been fed the notion that somehow dealing with climate is coming at their expense. No, it’s not. What is happening to them is happening because of other market forces are already taking place.” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) ripped Kerry for his “arrogant” comments. “It is not a unifying message, and it is not doing the job we should be doing [in] fighting for working men and women in this country,” Cruz said. “What an arrogant, out-of-touch statement for a centimillionaire to say,” Cruz shot back. “You know, ‘You little people, you know, I don’t like the choices you’re making, and so your jobs go away,’ as John Kerry said right there. Quelle surprise that the Democratic elites have decided that blue-collar workers, that union members, that men and women with calluses on their hands, they’ve made the wrong choices, in John Kerry’s words.” We’ll admit, we had to look up two words there. A “centimillionaire” is defined by Merriam Dictionary as “one whose wealth is estimated at one hundred million (as of dollars or pounds) or more,” which means Kerry is a multi-centimillionaire at the least. And “quelle” apparently means “what” in French, which Kerry famously speaks. “I’ve asked multiple Biden nominees what they would say to the union workers who just lost their jobs because Joe Biden decided they didn’t deserve a job,” Cruz told host Maria Bartiromo on Fox News. “And essentially nominee after nominee after nominee has said, ‘Well, tough luck.'” The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

435,https://www.dailywire.com/news/dan-crenshaw-rips-john-kerry-for-telling-laid-off-oil-workers-to-go-make-the-solar-panels,DW,Far Right,"Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) slammed John Kerry, the U.S. special presidential envoy for climate, on Wednesday for suggesting that workers losing their jobs in the fossil fuel industry can transition to jobs in clean energy. “John Kerry – worth hundreds of millions — telling blue-collar workers to just ‘go to work to make the solar panels.’ By the way, solar will pay on average $20K less than oil and gas jobs,” Crenshaw tweeted on Wednesday. “John Kerry thinks you should just shutup and accept it. No.” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) joined in, hitting Kerry and the Biden administration for pushing policies against fossil fuel production and development as part of President Joe Biden’s plan to combat climate change. “John Kerry’s message to the tens of thousands of Americans who lost their jobs thanks to the Biden administration: go make solar panels. Where is the empathy that Joe Biden promised in his inauguration?” Cotton tweeted on Wednesday. “John Kerry — who flies in private jets, owned a 76-foot yacht and several mansions — has the carbon footprint of a small nation. Yet he tells energy workers to ‘make solar panels’ when the Biden administration kills their jobs,” he later added. Kerry appeared at a press briefing on Wednesday to defend Biden’s plan to combat climate change and answer questions on the administration’s stance on coal and oil and gas development. Kerry blamed recent job losses in the oil and gas sector on “market forces” while asserting that laid-off workers could get better jobs in clean energy. “With respect to those workers, no two people are more, in this room, are more concerned about it. And the president of the United States has expressed in every comment he has made about climate the need to grow the new jobs that pay better, that are cleaner,” Kerry said. “You know, you look at the consequences of black lung for a miner, for instance, and measure that against the fastest growing job in the United States before COVID was solar power technician.

The Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) “registry shows a Gulfstream Aerospace jet owned by Flying Squirrel LLC, the name previously reported for Teresa Heinz-Kerry’s private charter jet company. The company’s listed address matches that of the Heinz Family Foundation,” Fox News reported. “According to FAA records, the jet’s registration certificate was issued in July of 2005 and expires in October of 2023.” Honeywell Aerospace noted in a 2019 report that private jets “burn 40 times as much carbon per passenger as regular commercial flights,” The Guardian reported. “During his 2004 presidential run, Kerry’s campaign made 60 payments to his wife’s charter jet company, totaling $273,171,” Fox News reporter Peter Hasson added. “As late as 2013, his executive branch personnel financial disclosure showed Kerry owning ‘over $1,000,001’ in assets for ‘Flying Squirrel LLC’ through his wife.” The mere appearance of hypocrisy by the climate-concerned Kerry is similar to a 2017 report that accused former Vice President Al Gore, also a Democrat, of using significantly more electricity at his mansion per year than the average American. The National Center for Public Policy Research said Gore’s electric bills from his Nashville home were “at least” 21 times higher than the average American household “because they only looked at the energy consumption at Gore’s Nashville home, not his other two houses,” according to The Hollywood Reporter. “In one peak month, September last year, Gore’s power consumption at the Nashville home reached 34 times that of a typical American home,” THR added. “The study indicates that Gore’s 20-room, 10,070 square-foot mansion used nearly 231,000 kilowatt hours of electricity in the last 12 months compared with less than 11,000 for an average American house. One of his findings, Johnson told The Hollywood Reporter, is that the amount of electricity Gore uses to heat his pool each year could power the average U.S. home for six years.” Kerry has faced criticism for remarks he made this week about green energy jobs and how those who work in the fossil fuel industry can get new jobs making solar panels. “What an arrogant, out-of-touch statement for a centimillionaire to say,” Sen.

437,https://www.dailywire.com/news/john-kerry-paris-agreement-not-enough,DW,Far Right,"President Joe Biden’s climate czar, John Kerry, claimed during a press conference on Wednesday that climate change presented an “existential” threat so severe that the Paris Climate Agreement alone is “not enough” and that if U.S. carbon emissions immediately dropped to “zero tomorrow” that the problem still would not be fixed. “The stakes on climate change just simply couldn’t be any higher than they are right now. It is existential,” Kerry claimed. “We use that word too easily, and we throw it away. But we have a big agenda in front of us on a global basis, and President Biden is deeply committed — totally seized by this issue, as you can tell by this executive order and by the other — the initiative for getting back into Paris immediately. That’s why he rejoined the Paris agreement so quickly, because he knows it is urgent.” “He also knows that Paris alone is not enough — not when almost 90 percent of all of the planet’s emissions — global emissions — come from outside of U.S. borders. We could go to zero tomorrow and the problem isn’t solved,” Kerry continued.  “So that’s why today, one week into the job, President Biden will sign this additional executive set of orders to help move us down the road, ensuring that ambitious climate action is global in scope and scale, as well as national, here at home.” Video and transcript below:  PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT: JOHN KERRY: Good afternoon, everybody. It’s great to be here. Let me say, first of all, what a pleasure it is to be here with Gina. I’m a big fan of Gina’s. Gina and I worked very, very closely together during the campaign, when we sat down to bring the Bernie Sanders folks together around the Biden climate plan. And she is the perfect person to be tackling the domestic side of this equation, which is complicated. And nobody knows the details better than she does, and nobody is going to be more effective in corralling everybody to move in the same direction. It’s also an enormous pleasure for me to be here with Jen Psaki. She mentioned that — nobody was her boss, but I had the privilege of working with her. And she — seven years ago, we gathered in the State Department briefing room. She’s traded up, obviously, but she has not given away any of her fundamental principles and commitment to telling you all the truth, telling the American people the truth, and doing so with great candor and transparency. And I’m very happy to be here with her. The stakes on climate change just simply couldn’t be any higher than they are right now. It is existential. We use that word too easily, and we throw it away. But we have a big agenda in front of us on a global basis, and President Biden is deeply committed — totally seized by this issue, as you can tell by this executive order and by the other — the initiative for getting back into Paris immediately. That’s why he rejoined the Paris agreement so quickly, because he knows it is urgent. He also knows that Paris alone is not enough — not when almost 90 percent of all of the planet’s emissions — global emissions — come from outside of U.S. borders. We could go to zero tomorrow and the problem isn’t solved. So that’s why today, one week into the job, President Biden will sign this additional executive set of orders to help move us down the road, ensuring that ambitious climate action is global in scope and scale, as well as national, here at home. Today, in the order that he will sign — that Gina has described to you — he makes climate central to foreign policy planning, to diplomacy, and to national security preparedness. It creates new platforms to coordinate climate action across the federal agencies and departments sorely needed. And most importantly, it commissions a National Intelligence Estimate on the security implications of climate change to give all of us an even deeper understanding of the challenges. This is the first time a president has ever done that. And our 17 intelligence agencies are going to come together and assess exactly what the danger and damage and potential risks are. The order directs the State Department to prepare a transmittal package, seeking Senate advice and consent on the Kigali Amendment, to the Montreal Protocol — an amendment that by itself, if ratified and fully enforced globally, could hold the Earth’s temperature by 0.5 of an entire degree — not insignificant. And it sets forth a process for us to develop an ambitious new Paris target, as well as a U.S. climate finance plan, both of which are essential to our being able to bring countries of the world together to raise ambition and meet this moment when we go to Glasgow for the follow-on agreement to Paris. So that’s the only way for the world to succeed together, my friends. And so, again, this is an issue where failure literally is not an option. As he committed to doing on the campaign trail, the President is announcing that he will host a Leaders Summit on Climate Change less than three months from now, on April 22nd, Earth Day, which will include a leader-level reconvening of the Major Economies Forum. We’ll have specifics to lay out over time. But the convening of this — of this summit is essential to ensuring that 2021 is going to be the year that really makes up for the lost time of the last four years and that the U.N. Climate Conference — COP26, as it’s called, which the UK is hosting in November — to make sure that it is an unqualified success. The Road to Glasgow will be marked not just by promises, but by progress, at a pace that we can all be proud of. And Gina is going to be putting her efforts into making certain that that is true. The world will measure us by what we can do here at home. So with these executive actions today, we believe we’re steps further down that journey. Thank you.

438,https://www.dailywire.com/news/watch-biden-nominee-for-commerce-wont-rule-out-gas-tax-funding-climate-change-agenda,DW,Far Right,"On Tuesday, Rhode Island Democrat Governor Gina Raimondo, President Biden’s nominee to be Secretary of the Department of Commerce, admitted that she would not rule out raising taxes on Americans in order to fulfill the administration’s climate change agenda. Florida Republican Senator Rick Scott asked Raimondo at her confirmation hearing, “What you’ve agreed to in the Transportation Climate Initiative, who will pay for that and how will a family making — half the families, individuals in your state make less than $32,000 a year — how will they pay for that and have you quantified it?” “We have not yet,” Raimondo answered. “The document I signed — by the way, it was bi-partisan, Republican and Democrat governors — was an intention to work together with our legislatures to develop a Transportation Climate Initiative, so it’s very early in that process.” Scott asked, “The nominee for Transportation Secretary, Mayor Buttigieg, last week said that he was receptive to increasing the gas tax, and again this would be something that would impact the poorest families in our country significantly. What is your position on that and how would that impact your ability to do your job as Secretary of Commerce?” “Yes, I would defer to Congress to make that decision,” Raimondo replied. “Let me say this: I, as governor, am deeply in touch with how much increasing bills affect the average American family. Having said that, we do need to meet the climate change challenge and we need funds for improved infrastructure: better roads, safer roads, safer bridges, which also creates jobs. So I would look to balance those interests and work as a piece of the president’s team.”  Raimondo is a strong supporter of the progressive climate change agenda; in January 2020 she issued an executive order stating that she ordered the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources to develop “policy pathways” to meet 100% of the state’s electricity demands with renewable energy resources by 2030. The Transportation Climate Initiative (TCI) Raimondo signed was co-signed by Massachusetts Republican Gov. Charlie Baker and Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont. On Tuesday, the Rhode Island Center for Freedom & Prosperity released a 10-page report, “The Effects of a TCI Gas Tax on Motor Fuels in Rhode Island,” researched and co-published by The Beacon Hill Institute, which slammed TCI, claiming it would raise gasoline prices and arguing that total social costs of that gas tax would be 105 times harsher than the anticipated social benefits, while global carbon emissions would be reduced by a miniscule 0.00016%. Mike Stenhouse, the Rhode Island Center’s CEO, stated, “The obvious purpose behind this TCI scheme is not environmental – it’s nothing more than a greedy money grab,” The report stated: “We find that the imposition of a carbon (or TCI) tax on motor fuels would produce a less-competitive business environment, resulting in a slower-growing economy that produces lower employment, disposable income, and investment. While the revenue generated under a carbon tax could be used to create new jobs, any new jobs would be created at the expense of the private sector.” The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

439,https://www.dailywire.com/news/bidens-climate-team-systemic-racism-is-to-blame-for-climate-change,DW,Far Right,"Two aides named by President-elect Joe Biden to handle environmental issues claim “systemic racism” is partially to blame for climate change. The Washington Free Beacon reported that Maggie Thomas has been tapped for the Office of Domestic Climate Policy chief of staff and Cecilia Martinez will serve as “senior director for environmental justice. Both incoming advisers have said racism drives climate change while insisting Biden’s environmental reforms should be based on “racial and economic justice.” In 2019, the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis released an “Equitable & Just” climate platform that demanded “environmental justice, equity and reducing pollution in overburdened communities” be front and center in the fight against climate change. “For too long, systemic racism and injustice have disproportionately exposed economically disadvantaged communities, tribal communities, and communities of color to the highest levels of toxic pollution. As the current COVID-19 crisis demonstrates, the interconnection between environmental and health risks has created crisis conditions for communities already battling toxic pollution that causes respiratory and other illnesses. Unless intentionally interrupted, systemic racism will continue to be a major obstacle to creating a healthy planet. The only path forward is to design national climate policies that are centered on justice,” Martinez said in a press release for the platform. Thomas has her own climate plan, which calls for trillions more in government spending to fight climate change, including more welfare programs such as rent and utility relief. The plan also demands the U.S. move away from fossil fuels. She demands Biden use executive action to establish a “government-wide environmental justice initiative” that would focus “federal environmental policy around equity, justice, and inclusion.” Daniel Turn, founder and executive director of the nonprofit organization Power the Future, told the Free Beacon that it looks like the incoming Biden administration is trying to justify nationalizing “the nation’s energy industry” under the pretenses of “racism” and “justice.” “Punishing America’s energy workers will do nothing to address climate change and it will do nothing to address injustices. It will, however, cause the prices of gas and utilities to rise sharply, and that will punish the less privileged most of all,” Turner told the outlet. “We do need to talk about housing, employment, and racism, but doing so under the pretext of energy policy will deliver muddied, expensive, and pointless legislation.” More from the Free Beacon: Thomas and Martinez’s climate plans in many ways mirror the Green New Deal, a $94 trillion bill introduced by progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) in 2019. The legislation calls for the “economic transformation” of the United States and aims to provide “adequate” federal housing for every American. While Biden has not explicitly endorsed the Green New Deal, he has praised the bill as “a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face” and included many of its components in his $2 trillion climate plan. The proposal, released in July 2019, pledges to “comprehensively address the most pressing, intersectional environmental justice issues” by targeting federal subsidies to minority groups.

440,https://www.dailywire.com/news/team-biden-vows-decisive-action-on-four-crises-in-first-ten-days,DW,Far Right,"Incoming White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain vowed Saturday that President-elect Joe Biden will take “decisive action” on four different crises affecting the country during his first ten days in office. In a memo to incoming senior White House staff, Klain identified the four crises as “the COVID-19 crisis, the resulting economic crisis, the climate crisis, and a racial equity crisis,” and promised Biden would take executive actions to address them. Some of Biden’s Day-One actions will include reversing the Trump administration’s ban on travel from certain Muslim-majority countries, rejoining the Paris Agreement, extending eviction protections, and launching a “100 Day Masking Challenge.” Klain said the so-called challenge will be accompanied by a mask mandate for people on federal property and for people engaging in interstate travel. (Biden announced back in December that he’d require masks on planes, trains, and buses traveling between states). The Biden administration will also extend a pause on federal student loan payments and interest and prevent interest from accruing for millions of borrowers, a policy first pursued by the Trump administration. The current student loan payment freeze is set to expire at the end of January. It’s not clear how long Biden wants to postpone payments. Klain said that on the day after the inauguration, Biden will sign executive orders related to COVID-19 testing and also sign orders related to unspecified worker protections and public health standards. Then on January 22, wrote Klain, Biden plans to “direct his cabinet agencies” to take unspecified “economic relief” actions for families. Other actions Biden plans to take in his first ten days include: Taking “significant early actions to advance equity and support communities of color and other underserved communities,” taking an unspecified action toward “reforming our criminal justice system,” and signing climate change-related executive actions. The memo was light on details but said more would be available in coming days. Earlier this week, Biden announced that he wants Congress to pass a $1,400 boost in direct relief stimulus checks and increase the unemployment supplement to $400 per week (up from $300 per week under the Trump administration). He also wants to extend those benefits, which expire in March, until the end of September, reports CNBC. According to National Review, Biden’s plan for Congress would cost about $1.9 trillion, which would include $400 billion for pandemic management, and $350 billion for state and local governments, as well as tribal governments. The proposal would also increase the federal minimum wage, which is currently $7.25 per hour, to $15 per hour. The Washington Post reports that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) had not commented on Biden’s relief plan as of Friday afternoon, but that a growing number of Republican senators were voicing opposition to it. “We cannot simply throw massive spending at this with no accountability to the current and future American taxpayer,” Senator Rick Scott (R-FL) said in a statement.
